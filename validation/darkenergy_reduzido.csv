Big bounce, slow-roll inflation, and dark energy from conformal gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043509	We examine the cosmological sector of a gauge theory of gravity based on the SO(4,2) conformal group of Minkowski space. We allow for conventional matter coupled to the spacetime metric as well as matter coupled to the field that gauges special conformal transformations. An effective vacuum energy appears as an integration constant, and this allows us to recover the late time acceleration of the Universe. Furthermore, gravitational fields sourced by ordinary cosmological matter (i.e. dust and radiation) are significantly weakened in the very early Universe, which has the effect of replacing the big bang with a big bounce. Finally, we find that this bounce is followed by a period of nearly exponential slow roll inflation that can last long enough to explain the large scale homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background.

On the covariant formalism of the effective field theory of gravity and its cosmological implications	10.1088/1361-6382/aa549d	Following our previous work wherein the leading order effective action was computed in the covariant effective field theory of gravity, here we specialize the effective action to the FRW spacetime and obtain the effective Friedmann equations. In particular, we focus our attention on studying the cosmological implications of the non-local terms when each of them is combined with the Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain both analytical and iterative solutions to the effective background equations in all the cases and also briefly comment on the consistency between the iterative and numerical solutions whenever possible. We find that among all the non-local terms, the imprints induced by R 1/square(2) R are very significant. Interpreting these corrections as an effective dark energy component characterized by an equation of state parameter, we find that the R 1/square(2) Rcorrection can indeed lead to an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch even in the absence of a cosmological constant. We briefly discuss some phenomenological consequences of our results.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Dynamics of higher-dimensional FRW cosmology in R-p exp(lambda R) gravity	10.1007/s12043-016-1335-2	We study the cosmological dynamics for R-p exp(lambda(R)) gravity theory in the metric formalism, using dynamical systems approach. Considering higher-dimensional FRW geometries in case of an imperfect fluid which has two different scale factors in the normal and extra dimensions, we find the exact solutions, and study its behaviour and stability for both vacuum and matter cases. It is found that stable solutions corresponding to accelerated expansion at late times exist, which can describe the inflationary era of the Universe. We also study the evolution of scale factors both in the normal and extra dimensions for different values of anisotropy parameter and the number of extra dimensions for such a scenario.

Role of tilted congruence and f(R) gravity on regular compact objects	10.1103/PhysRevD.95.024024	The purpose of this paper is to check the impact of observer and Palatini f(R) terms in the formulations of inhomogeneity factors of spherical relativistic systems. We consider the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dynamical model as a compact object and studied its evolution with both tilted and nontilted observers. We performed our analysis for particular cases of fluid distribution in tilted frame and found some energy density irregularity variables. We found that these variables are drastically different from those observed by a nontilted observer. The conformal flat dust and perfect matter contents are homogeneous as long as they impregnate vacuum core. However, this restriction is relaxed, when the complexity in the fluid description is increased. The radial fluid velocity due to tilted congruences and Palatini f(R) curvature terms tends to produce hindrances in the appearance of energy-density inhomogeneities in the initially regular spherical stellar populations.

Cosmological constant, fine structure constant and beyond	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-4581-z	In the present work, we consider the cosmological constant model , which is well motivated from three independent approaches. As is well known, the hint of varying fine structure constant was found in 1998. If is right, it means that the cosmological constant should also be varying. Here, we try to develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant , in which we view it from an interacting vacuum energy perspective. Then we consider the observational constraints on these models by using the 293 data from the absorption systems in the spectra of distant quasars. We find that the model parameters can be tightly constrained to the very narrow ranges of typically. On the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model from another perspective, namely it can be equivalent to a model containing ``dark energy{''} and ``warm dark matter{''	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Exacerbating the Cosmological Constant Problem with Interacting Dark Energy Models	10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.011302	Future cosmological surveys will probe the expansion history of the Universe and constrain phenomenological models of dark energy. Such models do not address the fine-tuning problem of the vacuum energy, i.e., the cosmological constant problem (CCP), but can make it spectacularly worse. We show that this is the case for ``interacting dark energy{''} models in which the masses of the dark matter states depend on the dark energy sector. If realized in nature, these models have far-reaching implications for proposed solutions to the CCP that require the number of vacua to exceed the fine-tuning of the vacuum energy density. We show that current estimates of the number of flux vacua in string theory, N-vac similar to O(10(272 000)), are far too small to realize certain simple models of interacting dark energy and solve the cosmological constant problem anthropically. These models admit distinctive observational signatures that can be targeted by future gamma-ray observatories, hence making it possible to observationally rule out the anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in theories with a finite number of vacua.

The complete Brans-Dicke theories	10.1016/j.aop.2016.11.013	Given that the simple wave equation of Brans-Dicke theory for the scalar field is preserved, we have investigated, through exhaustively analyzing the Bianchi identities, the consistent theories which violate the exact energy conservation equation. It is found that only three theories exist which are unambiguously determined from consistency, without imposing arbitrary functions by hand. Each of these theories possesses a specific interaction term which controls the energy exchange between the scalar field and ordinary matter. The theories contain new parameters (integration constants from the integration procedure) and when these are switched-off, Brans-Dicke theory emerges. As usually, the vacuum theories can be defined from the complete Brans-Dicke theories when the matter energy-momentum tensor vanishes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	ANNALS OF PHYSICS
Matter density perturbation and power spectrum in running vacuum model	10.1093/mnras/stw2549	We investigate the matter density perturbation delta(m) and power spectrum P(k) in the running vacuum model, with the cosmological constant being a function of the Hubble parameter, given by Lambda = Lambda(0) + 6 sigma HH0 + 3vH(2), in which the linear and quadratic terms of H would originate from the QCD vacuum condensation and cosmological renormalization group, respectively. Taking the dark energy perturbation into consideration, we derive the evolution equation for delta(m) and find a specific scale d(cr) = 2 pi/k(cr), which divides the evolution of the universe into the sub-interaction and super-interaction regimes, corresponding to k << k(cr) and k >> k(cr), respectively. For the former, the evolution of delta(m) has the same behaviour as that in the Lambda cold dark model, while for the latter, the growth of delta(m) is frozen (greatly enhanced) when nu + sigma > (<) 0 due to the couplings between radiation, matter and dark energy. It is clear that the observational data rule out the cases with nu < 0 and nu + sigma < 0, while the allowed window for the model parameters is extremely narrow with nu, vertical bar sigma vertical bar less than or similar to O(10 (7)).

Electromagnetic Casimir densities for a cylindrical shell on de Sitter space	10.1142/S0217751X16501839	Complete set of cylindrical modes is constructed for the electromagnetic field inside and outside a cylindrical shell in the background of (D + 1)-dimensional dS space-time. On the shell, the field obeys the generalized perfect conductor boundary condition. For the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, we evaluate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric field squared and of the energy-momentum tensor. The shell-induced contributions are explicitly extracted. In this way, for points away from the shell, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the VEVs in the boundary-free dS bulk. As a special case, the VEVs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the (D + 1)-dimensional Minkowski bulk. We show that the shell-induced contribution in the electric field squared is positive for both the interior and exterior regions. The corresponding Casimir-Polder forces are directed toward the shell. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the diagonal components, has a nonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction normal to the shell. This flux is directed from the shell in both the exterior and interior regions. For points near the shell, the leading terms in the asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding expressions in the Minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the proper distance in the dS bulk. The influence of the gravitational field on the local characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell larger than the dS curvature radius. The results are extended for confining boundary conditions of flux tube models in QCD.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Topological structure of the vacuum, cosmological constant and dark energy	10.1142/S0217751X16300519	In this review, we present a theory of cosmological constant and dark energy (DE), based on the topological structure of the vacuum. The multiple point principle (MPP) is reviewed. It demonstrates the existence of the two vacua into the SM. The Froggatt-Nielsen's prediction of the top-quark and Higgs masses is given in the assumption that there exist two degenerate vacua in the SM. This prediction was improved by the next-order calculations. We also considered Sidharth's theory of cosmological constant based on the noncommutative geometry of the Planck scale space-time, what gives an extremely small DE density providing the accelerating expansion of the Universe. Theory of two degenerate vacua - the Planck scale phase and electroweak (EW) phase -is also reviewed, topological defects in these vacua are investigated, also the Compton wavelength phase suggested by Sidharth is discussed. A general theory of the phase transition and the problem of the vacuum stability in the SM is reviewed. Assuming the existence of a new scalar S bound state 6t + 6 (t) over bar, earlier predicted by Froggatt, Nielsen and Laperashvili, we try to provide the vacuum stability in the SM and exact accuracy of the MPP.

Cosmological implications of DGP braneworld via well-known holographic dark energy models	10.1142/S0218271816501029	The cosmological analysis is being studied in the present work in Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld scenario by taking various interacting modified holographic dark energy (HDE) models. We discuss the various cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation-of-state (EoS) parameter and squared speed of sound. It is found that the trajectories of deceleration parameter exhibit in accelerated phase of the universe for all models. The EoS parameter corresponds to various phases of cosmic acceleration like quintessence, vacuum, phantom and also exhibits consistency with observational data. The squared speed of sound also gives stability of models in the current scenario. The omega(theta)-omega'(theta). also gives consistent results with various observational schemes. The statefinders plane also exhibits the cosmic acceleration. It is interesting to remark here that some of our results shows consistency with observational data like WMAP+CMB+BAO+H-0+SNe.

Symmetry breaking and onset of cosmic acceleration in scalar field models	10.1016/j.dark.2016.09.004	We propose a new scenario for the onset of positive acceleration of our Universe based on symmetry breaking in coupled dark energy scalar field model. In a symmetry breaking process where the scalar field rolls down its own potential, the potential reduction is not in favor of acceleration. In our model, when dark matter density becomes less than a critical value, the shape of the effective potential is changed and, the quintessence field climbs up along its own potential while rolls down the effective potential. We show that this procedure may establish the positivity of the potential required for the Universe to accelerate. In addition, we show that by choosing an appropriate interaction between dark sectors there is the possibility that the scalar field resides in a new vacuum giving rise to a positive cosmological constant which is responsible for a permanent late time acceleration.

Simple mass estimates for resonance(s) being 6 top+6 antitop bound states and combinations thereof	10.1142/S0217751X16501682	We have long speculated,(2,12,50-62) that 6 top + 6 antitop quarks due to the relatively large size of the top-Yukawa coupling would bind exceptionally strongly by mainly Higgs exchange. Here we present a surprisingly simple ``calculation{''} of the mass of this speculated bound state. Even a possible resonance in scattering of two such bound states is speculated. For the ``calculation{''} of the masses it is crucial to assume, that our since long speculated principle ``multiple point principle,{''} 5-18 is true. This principle says: there are several vacua all having almost zero energy density. Further, we make an approximation of the Higgs Yukawa potential essentially replacing the exponential in it by a step-function. The new result means that there are now two independent calls for our bound state having the mass around 750 GeV required by our ``new law of nature{''} the Multiple Point Principle. It should be remarked that in our picture there is no new physics in the sense of new fundamental particles, but the ``multiple point principle{''} is new in the sense of being not yet accepted. Further, we get the same mass within uncertainties as earlier2 but now from a completely different assumption, except for being from our ``multiple point principle.{''} But the two masses are gotten from using different (speculative) vacua occurring in the pure Standard Model.

Radiative Screening of Fifth Forces	10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.211102	We describe a symmetron model in which the screening of fifth forces arises at the one-loop level through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that such a theory can avoid current constraints on the existence of fifth forces but still has the potential to give rise to observable deviations from general relativity, which could be seen in cold atom experiments.

Gauss-Bonnet dark energy Chaplygin gas model	10.1140/epjp/i2016-16398-5	The correspondence of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) model and its modified (MGB) model of dark energy with the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas-scalar field models (SCG and GCG) have been studied in a flat universe. The exact solution of potentials and scalar fields, which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe, are reconstructed. According to the evolutionary behavior of the GB and MGB models, the same form of dynamics of scalar field and potential for different SCG and GCG models are derived. By calculating the squared sound speed of the MGB, GB model as well as the SCG, GCG, and investigating the GB-Chaplygin gas from the viewpoint of linear perturbation theory, we find that the best results, which are consistent with the observation, may appear by considering MGB-GCG. Also, we find out some bounds for parameters.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS

Cosmic anisotropic doomsday in Bianchi type I universes	10.1063/1.4967954	In this paper we study finite time future singularities in anisotropic Bianchi type I models. It is shown that there exist future singularities similar to Big Rip ones (which appear in the framework of phantom Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies). Specifically, in an ellipsoidal anisotropic scenario or in a fully anisotropic scenario, the three directional and average scale factors may diverge at a finite future time, together with energy densities and anisotropic pressures. We call these singularities ``Anisotropic Big Rip Singularities.{''} We show that there also exist Bianchi type I models filled with matter, where one or two directional scale factors may diverge. Another type of future anisotropic singularities is shown to be present in vacuum cosmologies, i.e., Kasner spacetimes. These singularities are induced by the shear scalar, which also blows up at a finite time. We call such a singularity ``Vacuum Rip.{''} In this case one directional scale factor blows up, while the other two and average scale factors tend to zero. Published by AIP Publishing.

Gravitational anti-screening as an alternative to the Lambda CDM model	10.1007/s10509-016-2953-3	Previously, in Penner (Astrophys. Space Sci., 361: 124, 2016), a theory of gravitational anti-screening was shown to lead to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relationship. In addition it was shown to agree with the observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, the observed features in the rotational curves of other spiral galaxies, and with observations of the Coma cluster. In this paper, the theory is now shown to be consistent with a geometrically flat universe. Using a model of the distribution of superclusters, the overall density parameter of the universe, as determined by the theory, is Omega = 1.08 +/- 0.19. In addition, the energy density which falls out from the theory has a negative pressure associated with it. This, along with a model of the evolution of superclusters, leads to an acceleration of the universal expansion without the requirement of dark energy. The theory of gravitational anti-screening therefore provides an alternative to the Lambda CDM model of cosmology.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Five dimensional minimally interacting holographic dark energy model in Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation	10.1007/s10509-016-2938-2	In this paper, we investigate five dimensional space-time filled with minimally interacting dark matter and holographic dark energy in Brans-Dicke (Phys. Rev. 124:925, 1961) scalar-tensor theory of gravitation. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained using (i) special law of variation for Hubble's parameter that yields constant value of deceleration parameter and (ii) a relation between metric potentials. The physical and geometrical aspects of the model are also discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
The black hole merger event GW150914 within a modified theory of general relativity	10.1093/mnras/stw1919	In 2016 February the first observation of gravitational waves were reported. The source of this event, denoted as GW150914, was identified as the merger of two black holes with about 30 solar masses each, at a distance of approximately 400 Mpc. These data were deduced using the theory of general relativity. Since 2009 a modified theory was proposed which adds near massive objects phenomenologically the contribution of a dark energy, whose origin are vacuum fluctuations. The dark energy accumulates towards smaller distances, reducing effectively the gravitational constant. In this contribution we show that as a consequence the deduces chirping mass and the luminosity distance are larger. This result suggests that the black hole merger corresponds to two massive black holes near the centre of primordial galaxies at large luminosity distance, i.e. large redshifts.

Correspondence of F(R) gravity singularities in Jordan and Einstein frames	10.1016/j.aop.2016.06.020	We study the finite time singularity correspondence between the Jordan and Einstein frames for various F(R) gravity theories. Particularly we investigate the ordinary pure F(R) gravity case and the unimodular F(R) gravity cases, in the absence of any matter fluids. In the ordinary F(R) gravity cases, by using specific illustrative examples, we show that it is possible to have various correspondences of finite time singularities, and in some cases it is possible a singular cosmology in one frame might be non-singular in the other frame. In the unimodular F(R) gravity case, the unimodular constraint is affected by the conformal transformation, so this has an effect on the metric we choose. Moreover, we study the Einstein frame counterpart theory of the unimodular F(R) gravity case, and we investigate the correspondences of the singularities in the two theories by considering specific illustrative examples. Finally, a brief dynamical system analysis is performed for the vacuum unimodular F(R) gravity and we demonstrate how the dynamical system behaves near the future Big Rip singularity.

Evolving extrinsic curvature and the cosmological constant problem	10.1088/0031-8949/91/10/105001	The concept of smooth deformation of Riemannian manifolds associated with the extrinsic curvature is explained and applied to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology. We show that such deformation can be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert-like dynamical principle may produce an observable effect in the sense of Noether. As a result, we show how the extrinsic curvature compensates both quantitative and qualitative differences between the cosmological constant. and the vacuum energy rho(vac) obtaining the observed upper bound for the cosmological constant problem at electroweak scale. The topological characteristics of the extrinsic curvature are discussed showing that the produced extrinsic scalar curvature is an evolving dynamical quantity.	PHYSICA SCRIPTA

Some physical and geometrical properties of the model are also discussed.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
About Dark Energy and Dark Matter in a Three-Dimensional Quantum Vacuum Model	10.1007/s10701-016-0021-z	A model of a three-dimensional quantum vacuum based on Planck energy density as a universal property of a granular space is suggested. The possibility to provide an unifying explanation of dark matter and dark energy as phenomena linked with the fluctuations of the three-dimensional quantum vacuum is explored. The changes and fluctuations of the quantum vacuum energy density generate a curvature of space-time similar to the curvature produced by a ``dark energy{''} density. The formation of large scale structures in the universe associated to the flattening of the orbital speeds of the spiral galaxies can be explained in terms of primary fluctuations of the quantum vacuum energy density without attracting the idea of dark matter.

EINSTEIN-CARTAN GRAVITY WITH TORSION FIELD SERVING AS AN ORIGIN FOR THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT OR DARK ENERGY DENSITY	10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/47	We analyse the Einstein-Cartan gravity in its standard form R = R + kappa(2), where. and R are the Ricci scalar curvatures in the Einstein-Cartan and Einstein gravity, respectively, and kappa(2) is the quadratic contribution of torsion in terms of the contorsion tensor kappa. We treat torsion as an external (or background) field and show that its contribution to the Einstein equations can be interpreted in terms of the torsion energy-momentum tensor, local conservation of which in a curved spacetime with an arbitrary metric or an arbitrary gravitational field demands a proportionality of the torsion energy-momentum tensor to a metric tensor, a covariant derivative of which vanishes owing to the metricity condition. This allows us to claim that torsion can serve as an origin for the vacuum energy density, given by the cosmological constant or dark energy density in the universe. This is a model-independent result that may explain the small value of the cosmological constant, which is a long-standing problem in cosmology. We show that the obtained result is valid also in the Poincare gauge gravitational theory of Kibble, where the Einstein-Hilbert action can be represented in the same form: R = R + kappa(2).

Quantum Weyl invariance and cosmology	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.034	Equations for cosmological evolution are formulated in a Weyl invariant formalism to take into account possible Weyl anomalies. Near two dimensions, the renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal energy-momentum tensor and a slowly decaying vacuum energy. A natural generalization to four dimensions implies a quantum modification of Einstein field equations at long distances. It offers a new perspective on time-dependence of couplings and naturalness with potentially far-reaching consequences for the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.

Running cosmological constant with observational tests	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.026	We investigate the running cosmological constant model with dark energy linearly proportional to the Hubble parameter, Lambda = sigma H + Lambda(0), in which the Lambda CDM limit is recovered by taking sigma = 0. We derive the linear perturbation equations of gravity under the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, and show the power spectra of the CMB temperature and matter density distribution. By using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we fit the model to the current observational data and find that sigma H-0/Lambda(0) less than or similar to 2.63 x 10(-2) and 6.74 x 10(-2) for Lambda(t) coupled to matter and radiation-matter, respectively, along with constraints on other cosmological parameters.

Effective cosmological constant induced by stochastic fluctuations of Newton's constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.015	We consider implications of the microscopic dynamics of spacetime for the evolution of cosmological models. We argue that quantum geometry effects may lead to stochastic fluctuations of the gravitational constant, which is thus considered as a macroscopic effective dynamical quantity. Consistency with Riemannian geometry entails the presence of a time-dependent dark energy term in the modified field equations, which can be expressed in terms of the dynamical gravitational constant. We suggest that the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe may be ascribed to quantum fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime rather than the vacuum energy from the matter sector.

Deformed matter bounce with dark energy epoch	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.064022	We extend the loop quantum cosmology matter bounce scenario in order to include a dark energy era, which ends abruptly at a rip singularity where the scale factor and the Hubble rate diverge. In the ``deformed matter bounce scenario,{''} the Universe is contracting from an initial noncausal matter dominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a decelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way, and thus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter dominated era. Depending on the choice of the free parameters of the model, the dark energy era is quintessential as what follows the matter domination era, and eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the end of the dark energy era, a rip singularity exists, where the scale factor and Hubble rate diverge; however, the physical system cannot reach the singularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex. This indicates two things, first that the ordinary loop quantum cosmology matter bounce evolution stops, thus ending the infinite repetition of the ordinary matter bounce scenario. Second, the fact that both the pressure and the density become complex probably indicates that the description of the cosmic evolution within the theoretical context of loop quantum cosmology ceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be rip singularity. We describe the qualitative features of the model, and we also investigate how this cosmology could be realized by a viscous fluid in the context of loop quantum cosmology. In addition to this, we show how this deformed model can be realized by a canonical scalar field filled Universe, in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be generated by a vacuum F(R) gravity.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Starobinsky-Like Inflation and Running Vacuum in the Context of Supergravity	10.3390/universe2030014	We describe the primeval inflationary phase of the early Universe within a quantum field theoretical (QFT) framework that can be viewed as the effective action of vacuum decay in the early times. Interestingly enough, the model accounts for the ``graceful exit{''} of the inflationary phase into the standard radiation regime. The underlying QFT framework considered here is supergravity (SUGRA), more specifically an existing formulation in which the Starobinsky-type inflation (de Sitter background) emerges from the quantum corrections to the effective action after integrating out the gravitino fields in their (dynamically induced) massive phase. We also demonstrate that the structure of the effective action in this model is consistent with the generic idea of re-normalization group (RG) running of the cosmological parameters; specifically, it follows from the corresponding RG equation for the vacuum energy density as a function of the Hubble rate, rho boolean AND (H). Overall, our combined approach amounts to a concrete-model realization of inflation triggered by vacuum decay in a fundamental physics context, which, as it turns out, can also be extended for the remaining epochs of the cosmological evolution until the current dark energy era.

The effect of backreaction of non-minimally coupled massless quintom fields in FLRW universe	10.1007/s10714-016-2114-6	In this paper the quantum backreaction of non-minimally coupled massless quintom fields in FLRW universe has been discussed. quintom model contains two massless scalar fields where one of scalar fields has positive kinetic energy and another one has negative kinetic energy term. In this model, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the full energy-momentum tensor in different cosmological eras including inflation, radiation and matter dominated eras on FRLW universe with constant epsilon. This quantity is divergent in different cases. In order to renormalize it, we separate the vacuum expectation values of the full energy-momentum tensor to the UV and IR parts by using mu cutoff. Then we eliminate the UV divergences by introducing a counterterm action and adding it to the action of the model. Also we calculate the IR part of the energy-momentum tensor during inflation and different transitions. For this purpose, we assume that the transition from one period to the next happens fast. Therefore we use a sudden transition approximation at matching time. In order to study behavior of the backreaction, we obtain the ratio of the dominant contribution of quantum energy density to the corresponding background quantity in different cosmological eras. Moreover, we show that the one-loop fluctuations of quintom model on de Sitter space give a contribution to the cosmological constant. Finally we obtain the effect of the quantum backreaction on the background geometry leading to new scale factor for cosmological eras.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Chameleon dark energy and atom interferometry	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044051	Atom interferometry experiments are searching for evidence of chameleon scalar fields with ever-increasing precision. As experiments become more precise, so too must theoretical predictions. Previous work has made numerous approximations to simplify the calculation, which in general requires solving a three-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation. This paper calculates the chameleonic force using a numerical relaxation scheme on a uniform grid. This technique is more general than previous work, which assumed spherical symmetry to reduce the partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation. We examine the effects of approximations made in previous efforts on this subject and calculate the chameleonic force in a setup that closely mimics the recent experiment of Hamilton et al. Specifically, we simulate the vacuum chamber as a cylinder with dimensions matching those of the experiment, taking into account the backreaction of the source mass, its offset from the center, and the effects of the chamber walls. Remarkably, the acceleration on a test atomic particle is found to differ by only 20\% from the approximate analytical treatment. These results allow us to place rigorous constraints on the parameter space of chameleon field theories, although ultimately the constraint we find is the same as the one we reported in Hamilton et al. because we had slightly underestimated the size of the vacuum chamber. This computational technique will continue to be useful as experiments become even more precise and will also be a valuable tool in optimizing future searches for chameleon fields and related theories.

Quantum cosmology near two dimensions	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044017	We consider a Weyl-invariant formulation of gravity with a cosmological constant in d-dimensional spacetime and show that near two dimensions the classical action reduces to the timelike Liouville action. We show that the renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal quantum momentum tensor which satisfies the Ward identities in a nontrivial way. The resulting evolution equations for an isotropic, homogeneous universe lead to slowly decaying vacuum energy and power-law expansion. We outline the implications for the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Improved cosmological model	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.043508	We study a class of nonlocal, action-based, and purely gravitational models. These models seek to describe a cosmology in which inflation is driven by a large, bare cosmological constant that is screened by the self-gravitation between the soft gravitons that inflation rips from the vacuum. Inflation ends with the Universe poised on the verge of gravitational collapse, in an oscillating phase of expansion and contraction that should lead to rapid reheating when matter is included. After the attainment of a hot, dense Universe the nonlocal screening terms become constant as the Universe evolves through a conventional phase of radiation domination. The onset of matter domination triggers a much smaller antiscreening effect that could explain the current phase of acceleration.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Spherically symmetric black holes in f(R) gravity: is geometric scalar hair supported?	10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155005	We critically discuss current research on black hole (BH) solutions in f (R) gravity and shed light on its geometrical and physical significance. We also investigate the meaning, existence or lack thereof of Birkhoff's theorem (BT) in this kind of modified gravity. We then focus on the analysis and search for non-trivial (i.e. hairy) asymptotically flat (AF) BH solutions in static and spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetimes in vacuum having the property that the Ricci scalar does not vanish identically in the domain of outer communication. To do so, we provide and enforce regularity conditions at the horizon in order to prevent the presence of singular solutions there. Specifically, we consider several classes of f (R) models like those proposed recently for explaining the accelerated expansion in the Universe and which have been thoroughly tested in several physical scenarios. Finally, we report analytical and numerical evidence about the absence of geometric hair in AFSSSBH solutions in those f (R) models. First, we submit the models to the available no-hair theorems (NHTs), and in the cases where the theorems apply, the absence of hair is demonstrated analytically. In the cases where the theorems do not apply, we resort to a numerical analysis due to the complexity of the non-linear differential equations. With that aim, a code to solve the equations numerically was built and tested using well-known exact solutions. In a future investigation we plan to analyze the problem of hair in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Modified Brans-Dicke cosmology with matter-scalar field interaction	10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155004	We discuss the cosmological implications of an extended Brans-Dicke theory presented recently, in which there is an energy exchange between the scalar field and ordinary matter, determined by the theory. A new mass scale is generated in the theory which modifies the Friedmann equations with field-dependent corrected kinetic terms. In a radiation Universe the general solutions are found and there are branches with complete removal of the initial singularity, while at the same time a transient accelerating period can occur within deceleration. Entropy production is also possible in the early Universe. In the dust era, late-times acceleration has been found numerically in agreement with the correct behavior of the density parameters and the dark energy equation of state, while the gravitational constant has only a slight variation over a large redshift interval in agreement with observational bounds.

Vacuum Cherenkov radiation and bremsstrahlung from disformal couplings	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/08/003	The simplest way to modify gravity is to extend the gravitational sector to include an additional scalar degree of freedom. The most general metric that can be built in such a theory includes disformal terms, so that standard model fields move on a metric which is the sum of the space time metric and a tensor constructed from first derivatives of the scalar. In such a theory gravitational waves and photons can propagate at different speeds, and these can in turn be different from the maximum speed limit for matter particles. In this work we show that disformal couplings can cause charged particles to emit Cherenkov radiation and bremsstrahlung apparently in vacuum, depending on the background evolution of the scalar field. We discuss the implications of this for observations of cosmic rays, and the constraints that arise for models of dark energy with disformal couplings.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
An analytic cosmology solution of Poincare gauge gravity	10.1142/S0219887816500961	A cosmology of Poincare gauge theory is developed. An analytic solution is obtained. The calculation results agree with observation data and can be compared with the Lambda CDM model. The cosmological constant puzzle is the coincidence and fine tuning problem are solved naturally at the same time. The cosmological constant turns out to be the intrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe, and is derived from the theory naturally rather than added artificially. The dark energy originates from geometry, includes the cosmological constant but differs from it. The analytic expression of the state equations of the dark energy and the density parameters of the matter and the geometric dark energy are derived. The full equations of linear cosmological perturbations and the solutions are obtained.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
Constraints from growth-rate data on some coupled dark energy models mimicking a I > CDM expansion	10.1093/mnras/stw1087	The Lambda CDM expansion can be mimicked by dark energy coupled to matter. In this case, the equation of state (w) over bar and (Q) over bar coupling of this coupled dark energy cannot be constrained by observations of the Hubble function alone. In this article, we determine the constraints on two such coupled dark energy models, considering some current and forecast Euclid-like growth-rate data and assuming the prior on the Lambda CDM dark matter density parameter today, Omega(m0) = 0.295 +/- 0.04. The first model is defined by a constant equation of state. We find that, at 2 sigma, (w) over bar = -1.02(-0.22)(+0.06) and the coupling function (Q) over bar (0) today is , (Q) over bar H-0(0)-3 = 0.057(-0.148)(+0.353), with H-0 the Hubble constant. The second model is defined by a varying equation of state (w) over bar = (w) over bar (a) - (w) over bar (b) ln(1 + z), with z the redshift and ((w) over bar (a), (w) over bar (b))two constants. We find that, at 2 sigma, \{(w) over bar (a) = -0.99(-0.90)(+0.17), (w) over bar (b) = -0.04(-1.17)(+0.31) and (Q) over bar H-0(0)-3 = 0.0002(-0.18)(+1.35)\}. These constraints on coupled dark energy agree with a Lambda CDM model but are too poor to discard with confidence coupled dark energy different from a vacuum but mimicking a Lambda CDM expansion.

Non-linear structure formation in the `Running FLRW' cosmological model	10.1093/mnras/stw1047	We present a suite of cosmological N-body simulations describing the `Running Friedmann-Lema < tre-Robertson-Walker' (R-FLRW) cosmological model. This model is based on quantum field theory in a curved space-time and extends Lambda cold dark matter (I > CDM) with a time-evolving vacuum density, I >(z), and time-evolving gravitational Newton's coupling, G(z). In this paper, we review the model and introduce the necessary analytical treatment needed to adapt a reference N-body code. Our resulting simulations represent the first realization of the full growth history of structure in the R-FLRW cosmology into the non-linear regime, and our normalization choice makes them fully consistent with the latest cosmic microwave background data. The post-processing data products also allow, for the first time, an analysis of the properties of the halo and sub-halo populations. We explore the degeneracies of many statistical observables and discuss the steps needed to break them. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative description of the deviations of R-FLRW from I > CDM, which could be readily exploited by future cosmological observations to test and further constrain the model.

New constraints on interacting dark energy from cosmic chronometers	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.023508	We use the latest compilation of observational Hubble parameter measurements estimated with the differential evolution of cosmic chronometers, in combination with the local value of the Hubble constant recently measured with 2.4\% precision, to constrain the cosmological scenario where dark energy interacts directly with the dark matter sector. To diminish the degeneracy between the parameters we additionally consider standard probes, such as supernovae type Ia from joint light-curve analysis samples, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements (BAO), and cosmic microwave background data from Planck 2015 estimations. Our analysis shows that the direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter is mildly favored, while the dark energy equation-of-state parameter is w < -1 at a 3 sigma confidence level.

Instability of Interacting Ghost Dark Energy Model in an Anisotropic Universe	10.1007/s10773-016-2961-7	A new dark energy model called ``ghost dark energy{''} was recently suggested to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. This model originates from the Veneziano ghost of QCD. The dark energy density is proportional to Hubble parameter, rho (I >) = alpha H, where alpha is a constant of order and I > (Q C D) similar to 100M e V is QCD mass scale. In this paper, we investigate about the stability of generalized QCD ghost dark energy model against perturbations in the anisotropic background. At first, the ghost dark energy model of the universe with spatial BI model with/without the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is discussed. In particular, the equation of state and the deceleration parameters and a differential equation governing the evolution of this dark energy model are obtained. Then, we use the squared sound speed the sign of which determines the stability of the model. We explore the stability of this model in the presence/absence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter in both flat and non-isotropic geometry. In conclusion, we find evidence that the ghost dark energy might can not lead to a stable universe favored by observations at the present time in BI universe.

Gauss-Bonnet cosmology unifying late and early-time acceleration eras with intermediate eras	10.1007/s10509-016-2800-6	In this paper we demonstrate that with vacuum F(G) gravity it is possible to describe the unification of late and early-time acceleration eras with the radiation and matter domination era. The Hubble rate of the unified evolution contains two mild singularities, so called Type IV singularities, and the evolution itself has some appealing features, such as the existence of a deceleration-acceleration transition at late times. We also address quantitatively a fundamental question related to modified gravity models description of cosmological evolution: Is it possible for all modified gravity descriptions of our Universe evolution, to produce a nearly scale invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations? As we demonstrate, the answer for the F(G) description is no, since the resulting power spectrum is not scale invariant, in contrast to the F(R) description studied in the literature. Therefore, although the cosmological evolution can be realized in the context of vacuum F(G) gravity, the evolution is not compatible with the observational data, in contrast to the F(R) gravity description of the same cosmological evolution.

The exact Riemann solutions to the generalized Chaplygin gas equations with friction	10.1016/j.cnsns.2015.12.013	The exact solutions to the Riemann problem for the one-dimensional generalized Chaplygin gas equations with a Coulomb-like friction term are constructed explicitly. The delta shock wave arises in the Riemann solutions provided that the initial data satisfy some certain conditions, although the system is strictly hyperbolic and the two characteristic fields are genuinely nonlinear. The position, strength and propagation speed of delta shock wave are obtained from the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. It is shown that the Coulomb-like friction term make waves (including rarefaction, shock and delta shock) bend into parabolic shapes for the Riemann solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cubic derivative interactions and asymptotic dynamics of the galileon vacuum	10.1088/0264-9381/33/12/125036	In this paper we apply the tools of the dynamical systems theory in order to uncover the whole asymptotic structure of the vacuum interactions of a galileon model with a cubic derivative interaction term. It is shown that, contrary to what occurs in the presence of background matter, the galileon interactions of vacuum appreciably modify the late-time cosmic dynamics. In particular, a local late-time attractor representing phantom behavior arises which is inevitably associated with a big rip singularity. It seems that the gravitational interactions of the background matter with the galileon screen the effects of the gravitational self-interactions of the galileon, thus erasing any potential modification of the late-time dynamics by the galileon vacuum processes. Unlike other galileon models inspired in the DGP scenario, self-accelerating solutions do not arise in this model.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
General analytic solutions of scalar field cosmology with arbitrary potential	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.123518	We present the solution space for the case of a minimally coupled scalar field with arbitrary potential in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This is made possible due to the existence of a nonlocal integral of motion corresponding to the conformal Killing field of the two-dimensional minisuperspace metric. Both the spatially flat and nonflat cases are studied first in the presence of only the scalar field and subsequently with the addition of noninteracting perfect fluids. It is verified that this addition does not change the general form of the solution, but only the particular expressions of the scalar field and the potential. The results are applied in the case of parametric dark energy models where we derive the scalar field equivalence solution for some proposed models in the literature.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological consequences of an adiabatic matter creation process	10.1093/mnras/stw566	In this paper, we investigate the cosmological consequences of a continuous matter creation associated with the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum. To illustrate this, three phenomenological models are considered. An equivalent scalar field description is presented for each models. The effects on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum are analysed for the first time in the context of adiabatic matter creation cosmology. Further, we introduce a model independent treatment, Om, which depends only on the Hubble expansion rate and the cosmological redshift to distinguish any cosmological model from Lambda cold dark matter by providing a null test for the cosmological constant, meaning that, for any two redshifts z(1), z(2), Om(z) is same, i.e. Om(z(1))-Om(z(2)) = 0. Also, this diagnostic can differentiate between several cosmological models by indicating their quintessential/phantom behaviour without knowing the accurate value of the matter density, and the present value of the Hubble parameter. For our models, we find that particle production rate is inversely proportional to Om. Finally, the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics bounded by the apparent horizon has been examined.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Ostrogradsky in theories with multiple fields	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/041	We review how the (absence of) Ostrogradsky instability manifests itself in theories with multiple fields. It has recently been appreciated that when multiple fields are present, the existence of higher derivatives may not automatically imply the existence of ghosts. We discuss the connection with gravitational theories like massive gravity and beyond Horndeski which manifest higher derivatives in some formulations and yet are free of Ostrogradsky ghost. We also examine an interesting new class of Extended Scalar-Tensor Theories of gravity which has been recently proposed. We show that for a subclass of these theories, the tensor modes are either not dynamical or are infinitely strongly coupled. Among the remaining theories for which the tensor modes are well-defined one counts one new model that is not field-redefinable to Horndeski via a conformal and disformal transformation but that does require the vacuum to break Lorentz invariance. We discuss the implications for the effective field theory of dark energy and the stability of the theory. In particular we find that if we restrict ourselves to the Extended Scalar-Tensor class of theories for which the tensors are well-behaved and the scalar is free from gradient or ghost instabilities on FLRW then we recover Horndeski up to field redefinitions.

Reissner-Nordstrm Anti-de Sitter Black Holes in Mimetic F (R) Gravity	10.3390/universe2020010	In this paper, we study under which conditions the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole can be a solution of the vacuum mimetic F (R) gravity with Lagrange multiplier and mimetic scalar potential. As the author demonstrates, the resulting picture in the mimetic F (R) gravity case is a trivial extension of the standard F (R) approach, and in effect, the metric perturbations in the mimetic F (R) gravity case, for the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole metric, at the first order of the perturbed variables are the same at the leading order.

Theoretical Derivation of the Cosmological Constant in the Framework of the Hydrodynamic Model of Quantum Gravity: Can the Quantum Vacuum Singularity Be Overcome?	10.3390/galaxies4020006	In the present work, it is shown that the problem of the cosmological constant (CC) is practically the consequence of the inadequacy of general relativity to take into account the quantum property of the space. The equations show that the cosmological constant naturally emerges in the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum gravity and that it does not appear in the classical limit because the quantum energy-impulse tensor gives an equal contribution with opposite sign. The work shows that a very large local value of the CC comes from the space where the mass of a quasi-punctual particle is present but that it can be as small as measured on cosmological scale. The theory shows that the small dependence of the CC from the mean mass density of the universe is due to the null contribution coming from the empty space. This fact gives some hints for the explanation of the conundrum of the cosmic coincidence by making a high CC value of the initial instant of universe compatible with the very small one of the present era.

Asymptotical null structure of an electro-vacuum spacetime with a cosmological constant	10.1142/S0218271816500863	Bondi-Sachs (BS) framework is a powerful tool to analyze the asymptotical null structure of a spacetime. Based on Bondi's outgoing boundary condition, the asymptotical null structure of an electro-vacuum spacetime without a cosmological constant has been constructed clearly. Recently more and more observations imply that the Einstein equation should be modified with an nonzero cosmological constant. It is interesting to investigate the asymptotical null structure of a spacetime with a cosmological constant. In this paper, we extend our previous result from vacuum case to electro-vacuum case. We find that the gravitational sector of the asymptotical null structure depends stronglyon the boundary conditions, while the electrical sector is independent of the boundary condition.

A note on Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in mimetic F(R) gravity	10.1142/S0218271816500784	In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime is a solution of the mimetic F(R) gravity with Lagrange multiplier and potential. As we demonstrate, the resulting mimetic F(R) gravity is a slight modification of the ordinary F(R) gravity case, however the resulting perturbation equations are not in all cases identical to the ordinary F(R) gravity case. In the latter case, the perturbation equations are identical to the ones corresponding to the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Tuning the cosmological constant, broken scale invariance, unitarity	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/028	We study gravity coupled to a cosmological constant and a scale but not con formally invariant sector. In Minkowski vacuum, scale invariance is spontaneously broken. We consider small fluctuations around the Minkowski vacuum. At the linearised level we find that the trace of metric perturbations receives a positive or negative mass squared contribution. However, only for the Fierz-Pauli combination the theory is free of ghosts. The mass term for the trace of metric perturbations can be cancelled by explicitly breaking scale invariance. This reintroduces fine-tuning. Models based on four form field strength show similarities with explicit scale symmetry breaking due to quantisation conditions.

Deflation of the cosmological constant associated with inflation and dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/039	In order to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant, we propose a simple model with the vacuum energy non-minimally coupled to the inflaton field. In this model, the vacuum energy decays to the inflaton during pre-inflation and inflation eras, so that the cosmological constant effectively deflates from the Planck mass scale to a much smaller one after inflation and plays the role of dark energy in the late-time of the universe. We show that our deflationary scenario is applicable to arbitrary slow-roll inflation models. We also take two specific inflation potentials to illustrate our results.

Rotation of the Universe at Different Cosmological Epochs	10.1134/S1063772916040041	A step-by-step foundation for the differential character of the Universe's rotation is presented. First, invoking the concept of spacetime foam with spin, it is reasonable to assume that the very early Universe can be described by the Dirac equation. Second, it is shown using the Ehrenfest theorem that, from a classical point of view, the early Universe can be described by the Papapetrou equations. Third, it is stressed that our Universe can perform only rotational motion. It is shown based on the spin part of the Papapetrou equations that the Universe's rotation depends appreciably on the physical properties of a specific cosmological epoch. The rotational angular velocity is calculated for three basic cosmological epochs: the matter-dominated epoch, the transition period (from domination of matter to domination of vacuum), and the vacuum-dominated epoch.

The Riemann problem for the Chaplygin gas equations with a source term	10.1002/zamm.201500015	The Riemann solutions for the one-dimensional Chaplygin gas equations with a Coulomb-like friction term are constructed explicitly. It is shown that the delta shock wave appears in the Riemann solutions in some certain situations. The generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions of delta shock wave are established and the position, propagation speed and strength of delta shock wave are given, which enables us to see the influence of Coulomb-like friction term on the Riemann solutions for the Chaplygin gas equations clearly. In addition, the relations connected with the area transportation are derived which include mass and momentum transportation. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Reconstruction of f (T)-gravity in the absence of matter	10.1007/s10509-016-2786-0	We derive an exact f (T) gravity in the absence of ordinary matter in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, where T is the teleparallel torsion scalar. We show that vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor Tau(mu nu). of matter does not imply vanishing of the teleparallel torsion scalar, in contrast to general relativity, where the Ricci scalar vanishes. The theory provides an exponential (inflationary) scale factor independent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained f (T) acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model. Nevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open universe provides a decaying pattern of the f (T) contributing directly to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant. The equation of state (EoS) of the torsion vacuum fluid has been studied in positive and negative Hubble regimes. We study the case when the torsion is made of a scalar field (tlaplon) which acts as torsion potential. This treatment enables to induce a tlaplon field sensitive to the symmetry of the spacetime in addition to the reconstruction of its effective potential from the f (T) theory. The theory provides six different versions of inflationary models. The real solutions are mainly quadratic, the complex solutions, remarkably, provide Higgs-like potential.

Ghost Dark Energy with Non-Linear Interaction Term	10.1007/s10773-016-2919-9	Here we investigate ghost dark energy (GDE) in the presence of a non-linear interaction term between dark matter and dark energy. To this end we take into account a general form for the interaction term. Then we discuss about different features of three choices of the non-linear interacting GDE. In all cases we obtain equation of state parameter, w (D) = p/rho, the deceleration parameter and evolution equation of the dark energy density parameter (Omega (D) ). We find that in one case, w (D) cross the phantom line (w (D) < -1). However in two other classes w (D) can not cross the phantom divide. The coincidence problem can be solved in these models completely and there exist good agreement between the models and observational values of w (D) , q. We study squared sound speed , and find that for one case of non-linear interaction term can achieves positive values at late time of evolution.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Conformal Gravity rotation curves with a conformal Higgs halo	10.1093/mnras/stw506	We discuss the effect of a conformally coupled Higgs field on conformal gravity (CG) predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies. The Mannheim-Kazanas (MK) metric is a valid vacuum solution of CG's fourth-order Poisson equation if and only if the Higgs field has a particular radial profile, S(r) = S-0 a/(r + a), decreasing from S-0 at r = 0 with radial scale-length a. Since particle rest masses scale with S(r)/S-0, their world lines do not follow time-like geodesics of the MK metric g(mu nu), as previously assumed, but rather those of the Higgs-frame MKmetric (g) over tilde (mu nu). = Omega(2)g(mu nu), with the conformal factor Omega(r)= S(r)/S-0. We show that the required stretching of the MK metric exactly cancels the linear potential that has been invoked to fit galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. We also formulate, for spherical structures with a Higgs halo S(r), the CG equations that must be solved for viable astrophysical tests of CG using galaxy and cluster dynamics and lensing.

Uniformly expanding vacuum: A possible interpretation of the dark energy	10.1016/j.dark.2016.02.002	Following the spirit of the equivalence principle, we take a step further to recognize the free fall of the observer as a method to eliminate causes that would lead the perceived vacuum to change its original state. Thus, it is expected that the vacuum should be in a rigid Minkowski state or be uniformly expanding. By carefully investigating the impact on measurement caused by the expansion, we clarify the exact meaning of the uniformly expanding vacuum and find that this proposal may be able to explain the current observations of an accelerating universe.

Ultralight gravitons with tiny electric dipole moment are seeping from the vacuum		Mass and electric dipole moment (EDM) of graviton,which is identified as dark matter particle (DMP), are estimated. This change the concept of dark matter and can help to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The calculations are based on quantum modification of the general relativity (Qmoger) with two additional terms in the Einstein equations, which takes into account production/absorption of gravitons. In this theory, there are no Big Bang in the beginning (some local bangs during the evolution of the universe are probable), no critical density of the universe, no dark energy (no need in cosmological constant) and no inflation. The theory (without fitting) is in good quantitative agreement with cosmic data.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Probing modified gravity with atom-interferometry: A numerical approach	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.104036	Refined constraints on chameleon theories are calculated for atom-interferometry experiments, using a numerical approach consisting in solving for a four-region model the static and spherically symmetric Klein-Gordon equation for the chameleon field. By modeling not only the test mass and the vacuum chamber but also its walls and the exterior environment, the method allows one to probe new effects on the scalar field profile and the induced acceleration of atoms. In the case of a weakly perturbing test mass, the effect of the wall is to enhance the field profile and to lower the acceleration inside the chamber by up to 1 order of magnitude. In the thin-shell regime, results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical estimations, when measurements are realized in the immediate vicinity of the test mass. Close to the vacuum chamber wall, the acceleration becomes negative and potentially measurable. This prediction could be used to discriminate between fifth-force effects and systematic experimental uncertainties, by doing the experiment at several key positions inside the vacuum chamber. For the chameleon potential V(phi) = Lambda(4+alpha)/phi(alpha) and a coupling function A(phi) = exp(phi/M), one finds M greater than or similar to 7 x 10(16) GeV, independently of the power-law index. For V(phi) = Lambda(4)(1 + Lambda/phi), one finds M greater than or similar to 10(14) GeV. A sensitivity of a similar to 10(-11) m/s(2) would probe the model up to the Planck scale. Finally, a proposal for a second experimental setup, in a vacuum room, is presented. In this case, Planckian values of M could be probed provided that a similar to 10(-10) m/s(2), a limit reachable by future experiments. Our method can easily be extended to constrain other models with a screening mechanism, such as symmetron, dilaton and f(R) theories.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmology in Poincare gauge gravity with a pseudoscalar torsion	10.1007/JHEP05(2016)024	A cosmology of Poincare gauge theory is developed, where several properties of universe corresponding to the cosmological equations with the pseudoscalar torsion function are investigated. The cosmological constant is found to be the intrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe and is derived from the theory naturally rather than added artificially, i.e. the dark energy originates from geometry and includes the cosmological constant but differs from it. The cosmological constant puzzle, the coincidence and fine tuning problem are relieved naturally at the same time. By solving the cosmological equations, the analytic cosmological solution is obtained and can be compared with the Lambda CDM model. In addition, the expressions of density parameters of the matter and the geometric dark energy are derived, and it is shown that the evolution of state equations for the geometric dark energy agrees with the current observational data. At last, the full equations of linear cosmological perturbations and the solutions are obtained.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Vacuum energy sequestering and conformal symmetry	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/05/002	In a series of recent papers Kaloper and Padilla proposed a mechanism to sequester standard model vacuum contributions to the cosmological constant. We study the consequences of embedding their proposal into a fully local quantum theory. In the original work, the bare cosmological constant Lambda and a scaling parameter lambda are introduced as global fields. We find that in the local case the resulting Lagrangian is that of a spontaneously broken conformal field theory where lambda plays the role of the dilaton. A vanishing or a small cosmological constant is thus a consequence of the underlying conformal field theory structure.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Connecting inflation with late cosmic acceleration by particle production	10.1142/S021827181650067X	A continuous process of creation of particles is investigated as a possible connection between the inflationary stage with late cosmic acceleration. In this model, the inflationary era occurs due to a continuous and fast process of creation of relativistic particles, and the recent accelerating phase is driven by the nonrelativistic matter creation from the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum, which finally results in an effective equation of state (EoS) less than -1. Thus, explaining recent results in favor of a phantom dynamics without the need of any modifications in the gravity theory has been proposed. Finally, we confront the model with recent observational data of type Ia Supernova, history of the Hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Holographic Ricci dark energy as running vacuum	10.1142/S0217732316500759	Holographic Ricci dark energy (DE) that has been proposed ago has faced problems of future singularity. In the present work, we consider the Ricci DE with an additive constant in its density as running vacuum energy. We have analytically solved the Friedmann equations and also the role played by the general conservation law followed by the cosmic components together. We have shown that the running vacuum energy status of the Ricci DE helps to remove the possible future singularity in the model. The additive constant in the density of the running vacuum played an important role, such that, without that, the model predicts either eternal deceleration or eternal acceleration. But along with the additive constant, equivalent to a cosmological constant, the model predicts a late time acceleration in the expansion of the universe, and in the far future of the evolution it tends to de Sitter universe.

Gravitational lensing by gravastars	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.084051	As a possible method to detect gravastars (gravitational-vacuum-star), which was originally proposed by Mazur and Mottola, we study their gravitational lensing effects. Specifically, we adopt a spherical thin-shell model of a gravastar developed by Visser and Wiltshire, which connects interior de Sitter geometry and exterior Schwarzschild geometry, and assume that its surface is optically transparent. We calculate the image of a companion which rotates around the gravastar; we find that some characteristic images appear, depending on whether the gravastar possess unstable circular orbits of photons (Model 1) or not (Model 2). For Model 2, we calculate the total luminosity change, which is called microlensing effects; the maximal luminosity could be considerably larger than the black hole with the same mass.

Thermodynamical aspects of running vacuum models	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-4060-6	The thermal history of a large class of running vacuum models in which the effective cosmological term is described by a truncated power series of the Hubble rate, whose dominant term is Lambda (H) proportional to Hn+2, is discussed in detail. Specifically, by assuming that the ultrarelativistic particles produced by the vacuum decay emerge into space-time in such a way that its energy density rho(r) proportional to T-4, the temperature evolution law and the increasing entropy function are analytically calculated. For the whole class of vacuum models explored here we find that the primeval value of the comoving radiation entropy density (associated to effectively massless particles) starts from zero and evolves extremely fast until reaching a maximum near the end of the vacuum decay phase, where it saturates. The late-time conservation of the radiation entropy during the adiabatic FRW phase also guarantees that the whole class of running vacuum models predicts the same correct value of the present day entropy, S-0 similar to 10(87)-10(88) (in natural units), independently of the initial conditions. In addition, by assuming Gibbons-Hawking temperature as an initial condition, we find that the ratio between the late-time and primordial vacuum energy densities is in agreement with naive estimates from quantum field theory, namely, rho(Lambda 0/rho Lambda I) similar to 10(-123). Such results are independent on the power n and suggests that the observed Universe may evolve smoothly between two extreme, unstable, non-singular de Sitter phases.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
An interesting consequence of the general principle of relativity	10.1140/epjp/i2016-16091-9	We show that Einstein's general theory of relativity, together with the assumption that the principle of relativity encompasses rotational motion, predicts that in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe model with dust and Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy (LIVE), the density parameter of vacuum energy must have the value Omega(Lambda 0) = 0.737. The physical mechanism connecting the relativity of rotational motion with the energy density of dark energy is the inertial dragging effect. The predicted value is necessary in order to have perfect inertial dragging, which is required for rotational motion to be relative. If one accepts that due to the impossibility of defining motion for a single particle in an otherwise empty universe, the universe must be constructed so that all types of motion are relative, then this solves the so-called cosmological constant problem.

Matter perturbations in scaling cosmology	10.1093/mnras/stw127	A suitable nonlinear interaction between dark matter with an energy density rho(M) and dark energy with an energy density rho(X) is known to give rise to a non-canonical scaling rho(M) proportional to rho(a-xi)(X), where xi is a parameter which generally deviates from xi = 3. Here, we present a covariant generalization of this class of models and investigate the corresponding perturbation dynamics. The resulting matter power spectrum for the special case of a time-varying Lambda model is compared with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR9 catalogue (Ahn et al.). We find a best-fitting value of xi = 3.25 which corresponds to a decay of dark matter into the cosmological term. Our results are compatible with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at the 2 sigma confidence level.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
On the smallness of the cosmological constant	10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.09.237	In N = 1 supergravity the scalar potential of the hidden sector may have degenerate supersymmetric (SUSY) and non-supersymmetric Minkowski vacua. In this case local SUSY in the second supersymmetric Minkowski phase can be broken dynamically. Assuming that such a second phase and the phase associated with the physical vacuum are exactly degenerate, we estimate the value of the cosmological constant. We argue that the observed value of the dark energy density can be reproduced if in the second vacuum local SUSY breaking is induced by gaugino condensation at a scale which is just slightly lower than Lambda(QCD) in the physical vacuum. The presence of a third degenerate vacuum, in which local SUSY and electroweak (EW) symmetry are broken near the Planck scale, may lead to small values of the quartic Higgs self coupling and the corresponding beta function at the Planck scale in the phase in which we live.	
Gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time and gravitational interaction	10.1134/S0202289316020109	The place and physical significance of gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan spacetime (GTRC) in the framework of the gauge approach to gravitation is discussed. Isotropic cosmology built on the basis of GTRC with a general expression of the gravitational Lagrangian with indefinite parameters is considered. The most important physical consequences connected with a change of the gravitational interaction, with possible existence of limiting energy density and gravitational repulsion at extreme conditions, and also with the vacuum repulsion effect are discussed. A solution of the problem of cosmological singularity and the dark energy problem as a result of the change of the gravitational interaction is considered.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Vacuum fluctuation inside a star and their consequences for neutron stars, a simple model	10.1142/S0218301316500270	Applying semi-classical quantum mechanics, the vacuum fluctuations within a star are determined, assuming a constant mass density and applying a monopole approximation. It is found that the density for the vacuum fluctuations does not only depend linearly on the mass density, as assumed in a former publication, where neutron stars up to 6 solar masses were obtained. This is used to propose a simple model on the dependence of the dark energy to the mass density, as a function of the radial distance r. It is shown that stars with up to 200 solar masses can, in principle, be obtained. Though, we use a phenomenological model, it shows that in the presence of vacuum fluctuations stars with large masses can be stabilized and probably stars up to any mass can exist, which usually are identified as black holes.

Interaction of Gravitational field and Brans-Dicke field in R/W universe containing Dark Energy like fluid	10.1088/1674-4527/16/4/064	On studying some new models of Robertson-Walker universes with a Brans-Dicke scalar field, it is found that most of these universes contain a dark energy like fluid which confirms the present scenario of the expansion of the universe. In one of the cases, the exact solution of the field equations gives a universe with a false vacuum, while in another it reduces to that of dust distribution in the Brans-Dicke cosmology when the cosmological constant is not in the picture. In one particular model it is found that the universe may undergo a Big Rip in the future, and thus it will be very interesting to investigate such models further.

Dark energy in the three-body problem: Wide triple galaxies	10.1134/S1063772916030045	The structure and evolution of triple galaxy systems in the presence of the cosmic dark-energy background is studied in the framework of the three-body problem. The dynamics of wide triple systems are determinedmainly by the competition between the mutual gravitational forces between the three bodies and the anti-gravity created by the dark-energy background. This problem can be solved via numerical integration of the equations of motion with initial conditions that admit various types of evolutionary behavior of the system. Such dynamical models show that the anti-gravity created by dark energy makes a triple system less tightly bound, thereby facilitating its decay, with a subsequent transition to motion of the bodies away from each other in an accelerating regime with a linear Hubble-law dependence of the velocity on distance. The coefficient of proportionality between the velocity and distance in this asymptotic relation corresponds to the universal value H (I >) = 61 km s(-1) Mpc(-1), which depends only on the dark-energy density. The similarity of this relation to the large-scale recession of galaxies indicates that double and triple galaxies represent elementary dynamical cells realizing the overall behavior of a system dominated by dark energy on their own scale, independent of their masses and dimensions.

Rewriting the rules governing high intensity interactions of light with matter	10.1088/0034-4885/79/4/046401	The trajectory of discovery associated with the study of high-intensity nonlinear radiative interactions with matter and corresponding nonlinear modes of electromagnetic propagation through material that have been conducted over the last 50 years can be presented as a landscape in the intensity/quantum energy [I-h.] plane. Based on an extensive series of experimental and theoretical findings, a universal zone of anomalous enhanced electromagnetic coupling, designated as the fundamental nonlinear domain, can be defined. Since the lower boundaries of this region for all atomic matter correspond to hw similar to 10(3) eV and I approximate to 10(16) W cm(-2), it heralds a future dominated by x-ray and.-ray studies of all phases of matter including nuclear states. The augmented strength of the interaction with materials can be generally expressed as an increase in the basic electromagnetic coupling constant in which the fine structure constant alpha -> Z(2)alpha, where Z denotes the number of electrons participating in an ordered response to the driving field. Since radiative conditions strongly favoring the development of this enhanced electromagnetic coupling are readily produced in self-trapped plasma channels, the processes associated with the generation of nonlinear interactions with materials stand in natural alliance with the nonlinear mechanisms that induce confined propagation. An experimental example involving the Xe (4d(10)5s(2)5p(6)) supershell for which Z congruent to 18 that falls in the specified anomalous nonlinear domain is described. This yields an effective coupling constant of Z(2)alpha congruent to 2.4 > 1, a magnitude comparable to the strong interaction and a value rendering as useless conventional perturbative analyses founded on an expansion in powers of a. This enhancement can be quantitatively understood as a direct consequence of the dominant role played by coherently driven multiply-excited states in the dynamics of the coupling. It is also conclusively demonstrated by an abundance of data that the utterly peerless champion of the experimental campaign leading to the definition of the fundamental nonlinear domain was excimer laser technology. The basis of this unique role was the ability to satisfy simultaneously a triplet (w, I, P) of conditions stating the minimal values of the frequency., intensity I, and the power P necessary to enable the key physical processes to be experimentally observed and controllably combined. The historical confluence of these developments creates a solid foundation for the prediction of future advances in the fundamental understanding of ultra-high power density states of matter. The atomic findings graciously generalize to the composition of a nuclear stanza expressing the accessibility of the nuclear domain. With this basis serving as the launch platform, a cadenza of three grand challenge problems representing both new materials and new interactions is presented for future solution; they are (1) the performance of an experimental probe of the properties of the vacuum state associated with the dark energy at an intensity approaching the Schwinger/Heisenberg limit, (2) the attainment of amplification in the gamma-ray region (similar to 1 MeV) and the discovery of a nuclear excimer, and (3) the determination of a path to the projected super-heavy nuclear island of stability.

Anisotropic universe with magnetized dark energy	10.1007/s10509-016-2708-1	In the present work we have searched the existence of the late time acceleration of the Universe filled with cosmic fluid and uniform magnetic field as source of matter in anisotropic Heckmann-Schucking space-time. The observed acceleration of universe has been explained by introducing a positive cosmological constant. in the Einstein's field equation which is mathematically equivalent to vacuum energy with equation of state (EOS) parameter set equal to -1. The present values of the matter and the dark energy parameters (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda)) 0 are estimated in view of the latest 287 high red shift (0.3 <= z <= 1.4) SN Ia supernova data's of observed apparent magnitude along with their possible error taken from Union 2.1 compilation. It is found that the best fit value for (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda)) 0 are 0.2820 & 0.7177 respectively which are in good agreement with recent astrophysical observations in the latest surveys like WMAP [2001-2013], Planck [latest 2015] & BOSS. Various physical parameters such as the matter and dark energy densities, the present age of the universe and deceleration parameter have been obtained on the basis of the values of (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda))(0). Also we have estimated that the acceleration would have begun in the past at z = 0.71131 similar to 6.2334 Gyrs before from present.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Bounding f(R) gravity by particle production rate	10.1142/S021827181630010X	Several models of f(R) gravity have been proposed in order to address the dark side problem in cosmology. However, these models should be constrained also at ultraviolet scales in order to achieve some correct fundamental interpretation. Here, we analyze this possibility comparing quantum vacuum states in given f(R) cosmological backgrounds. Specifically, we compare the Bogolubov transformations associated to different vacuum states for some f(R) models. The procedure consists in fixing the f(R) free parameters by requiring that the Bogolubov coefficients can be correspondingly minimized to be in agreement with both high redshift observations and quantum field theory predictions. In such a way, the particle production is related to the value of the Hubble parameter and then to the given f(R) model. The approach is developed in both metric and Palatini formalism.

Neutron limit on the strongly-coupled chameleon field	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.062001	The physical origin of the dark energy that causes the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe is one of the major open questions of cosmology. One set of theories postulates the existence of a self-interacting scalar field for dark energy coupling to matter. In the chameleon dark energy theory, this coupling induces a screening mechanism such that the field amplitude is nonzero in empty space but is greatly suppressed in regions of terrestrial matter density. However measurements performed under appropriate vacuum conditions can enable the chameleon field to appear in the apparatus, where it can be subjected to laboratory experiments. Here we report the most stringent upper bound on the free neutron-chameleon coupling in the strongly coupled limit of the chameleon theory using neutron interferometric techniques. Our experiment sought the chameleon field through the relative phase shift it would induce along one of the neutron paths inside a perfect crystal neutron interferometer. The amplitude of the chameleon field was actively modulated by varying the millibar pressures inside a dual-chamber aluminum cell. We report a 95\% confidence level upper bound on the neutron-chameleon coupling beta ranging from beta < 4.7 x 10(6) for a Ratra-Peebles index of n = 1 in the nonlinear scalar field potential to beta < 2.4 x 10(7) for n = 6, one order of magnitude more sensitive than the most recent free neutron limit for intermediate n. Similar experiments can explore the full parameter range for chameleon dark energy in the foreseeable future.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Quantum Yang-Mills Dark Energy	10.3390/universe2010004	In this short review, I discuss basic qualitative characteristics of quantum non-Abelian gauge dynamics in the non-stationary background of the expanding Universe in the framework of the standard Einstein-Yang-Mills formulation. A brief outlook of existing studies of cosmological Yang-Mills fields and their properties will be given. Quantum effects have a profound impact on the gauge field-driven cosmological evolution. In particular, a dynamical formation of the spatially-homogeneous and isotropic gauge field condensate may be responsible for both early and late-time acceleration, as well as for dynamical compensation of non-perturbative quantum vacua contributions to the ground state of the Universe. The main properties of such a condensate in the effective QCD theory at the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background will be discussed within and beyond perturbation theory. Finally, a phenomenologically consistent dark energy can be induced dynamically as a remnant of the QCD vacua compensation arising from leading-order graviton-mediated corrections to the QCD ground state.

Locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with vacuum energy density and magnetic field in general relativity	10.1139/cjp-2015-0691	A locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with vacuum energy density (A) and magnetic field is investigated. To get a deterministic model of the universe, we assume that shear (sigma) is proportional to expansion (theta) and A similar to 1/R-2 as considered by Chen and Wu (Phys. Rev. D, 41, 695 (1990)) where R is a scale factor. We find that the total energy density (rho), the particle density rho(p) decreases with time. The strong energy conditions as given by Hawking and Ellis (The large scale structure of space-time. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. p. 88. (1974)) are satisfied. The vacuum energy density decreases with time, which matches with astronomical observation. The model in general represents anisotropic space-time because of the presence of strings. The total energy density and string tension density decrease because of the presence of a magnetic field. Both the models have point-type singularities at T = 0 and tau = 0, respectively. The other physical aspects of the models are also discussed.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Is Lambda CDM an effective CCDM cosmologdy?	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/03/027	We show that a cosmology driven by gravitationally induced particle production of all non-relativistic species existing in the present Universe mimics exactly the observed flat accelerating Lambda CDM cosmology with just one dynamical free parameter. This kind of scenario includes the creation cold dark matter (CCDM) model [15] as a particular case and also provides a natural reduction of the dark sector since the vacuum component is not needed to accelerate the Universe. The new cosmic scenario is equivalent to Lambda CDM both at the background and perturbative levels and the associated creation process is also in agreement with the universality of the gravitational interaction and equivalence principle. Implicitly, it also suggests that the present day astronomical observations cannot be considered the ultimate proof of cosmic vacuum effects in the evolved Universe because Lambda CDM may be only an effective cosmology.

Cosmological evolution with the cubic order field derivative coupling	10.1007/s10714-016-2025-6	We investigate cosmological evolution in the scalar-tensor theory with the field derivative coupling to the double-dual of the Riemann tensor (the cubic-type theory). The theory can be seen as the straightforward extension of the scalar-tensor with the quadratic order field derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor (the quadratic-type theory). Both the field derivative couplings to the Einstein tensor and the double-dual of the Riemann tensor have been argued in terms of the successful realization of the self-tuning of the cosmological constant within the Horndeski theory. Assuming the constant potential given by the sum of the cosmological constant and the quantum vacuum energy, the shift symmetry for the scalar field and no matter fields, in the spatially-flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, we can reduce the set of the field equations to the first-order ordinary nonlinear differential equation for the Hubble parameter, showing the existence of the self-tuned and runaway de Sitter solutions, in addition to the standard de Sitter solutions in general relativity and the finite Hubble singularities which can be reached within the finite time. We then argue the possible cosmological evolution in terms of the values of the effective cosmological constant, the kinetic coupling constants and the initial Hubble parameter. Although the behavior of the universe around each of the de Sitter solutions as well as the finite time singularities is very similar in both theories, we find that the crucial difference appears in terms of no bounce or turnaround behavior across the vanishing Hubble parameter as well as no limitation for the range of the Hubble parameter in the cubic-type theory.

The minimum mass of a charged spherically symmetric object in D dimensions, its implications for fundamental particles, and holography	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-3948-5	We obtain bounds for the minimum and maximum mass/radius ratio of a stable, charged, spherically symmetric compact object in a D-dimensional space-time in the framework of general relativity, and in the presence of dark energy. The total energy, including the gravitational component, and the stability of objects with minimum mass/radius ratio is also investigated. The minimum energy condition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged objects with minimum mass/radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy only. As applied to the electron in the four-dimensional case, this procedure allows one to re-obtain the classical electron radius from purely general relativistic considerations. By combining the lower mass bound, in four space-time dimensions, with minimum length uncertainty relations (MLUR) motivated by quantum gravity, we obtain an alternative bound for the maximum charge/mass ratio of a stable, gravitating, charged quantum mechanical object, expressed in terms of fundamental constants. Evaluating this limit numerically, we obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratio of the electron, as required by the stability conditions. This suggests that, if the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if its charge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic and dark energy repulsion would destabilize the Compton radius. In other words, the electron would blow itself apart. Our results suggest the existence of a deep connection between gravity, the presence of the cosmological constant, and the stability of fundamental particles.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Yang-Mills condensate as dark energy: A nonperturbative approach	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043012	Models based on the Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) have been advocated for in the literature and claimed as successful candidates for explaining dark energy. Several variations on this simple idea have been considered, the most promising of which are reviewed here. Nevertheless, the previously attained results relied heavily on the perturbative approach to the analysis of the effective Yang-Mills action, which is only adequate in the asymptotically free limit, and were extended into a regime, the infrared limit, in which confinement is expected. We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in theta = -F-mu nu(a) F-a mu nu/2 exists, a YMC forms that drives the Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase. The details of the models depend weakly on the specific form of the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian. Using nonperturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalization-group procedure, we finally show that the minimum in theta of the effective Lagrangian exists. Thus, a YMC can actually take place. The nonperturbative model has properties similar to the ones in the perturbative model. In the early stage of the Universe, the YMC equation of state has an evolution that resembles the radiation component, i.e., w(y) -> 1/3. However, in the late stage, wy naturally runs to the critical state with w(y) = -1, and the Universe transitions from a matter-dominated into a dark energy dominated stage only at latest time, at a redshift whose value depends on the initial conditions that are chosen while solving the dynamical system.

Lovelock-Brans-Dicke gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/33/4/045001	According to Lovelock's theorem, the Hilbert-Einstein and the Lovelock actions are indistinguishable from their field equations. However, they have different scalar-tensor counterparts, which correspond to the Brans-Dicke and the Lovelock-Brans-Dicke (LBD) gravities, respectively. In this paper the LBD model of alternative gravity with the Lagrangian density L-LBD = 1/16 pi[phi(R + a/root-g{*}RR + bG) - L-omega/phi del(alpha)phi del(alpha)phi] is developed, where {*}RR and G respectively denote the topological Chern-Pontryagin and Gauss-Bonnet invariants. The field equation, the kinematical and dynamical wave equations, and the constraint from energy-momentum conservation are all derived. It is shown that the LBD gravity reduces to general relativity in the limit L-omega -> infinity unless the `topological balance condition' holds, and in vacuum it can be conformally transformed into the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and the generalized Gauss-Bonnet dark energy with Horndeski-like or Galileon-like kinetics. Moreover, the LBD gravity allows for the late-time cosmic acceleration without dark energy. Finally, the LBD gravity is generalized into the Lovelock-scalar-tensor gravity, and its equivalence to fourth-order modified gravities is established. It is also emphasized that the standard expressions for the contributions of generalized Gauss-Bonnet dependence can be further simplified.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
General form of entropy on the horizon of the universe in entropic cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043530	Entropic cosmology assumes several forms of entropy on the horizon of the universe, where the entropy can be considered to behave as if it were related to the exchange (the transfer) of energy. To discuss this exchangeability, the consistency of the two continuity equations obtained from two different methods is examined, focusing on a homogeneous, isotropic, spatially flat, and matter-dominated universe. The first continuity equation is derived from the first law of thermodynamics, whereas the second equation is from the Friedmann and acceleration equations. To study the influence of forms of entropy on the consistency, a phenomenological entropic-force model is examined, using a general form of entropy proportional to the nth power of the Hubble horizon. In this formulation, the Bekenstein entropy (an area entropy), the Tsallis-Cirto black-hole entropy (a volume entropy), and a quartic entropy are represented by n = 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The two continuity equations for the present model are found to be consistent with each other, especially when n = 2, i.e., the Bekenstein entropy. The exchange of energy between the bulk (the universe) and the boundary (the horizon of the universe) should be a viable scenario consistent with the holographic principle.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Classical and quantum solutions in Brans-Dicke cosmology with a perfect fluid	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043528	We consider the application of group invariant transformations in order to constrain a flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model, containing a Brans-Dicke scalar field and a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state parameter w, where the latter is not interacting with the scalar field in the gravitational action integral. The requirement that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation be invariant under one-parameter point transformations provides us with two families of power-law potentials for the Brans-Dicke field, in which the powers are functions of the Brans-Dicke parameter omega(BD) and the parameter w. The existence of the Lie symmetry in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is equivalent to the existence of a conserved quantity in field equations and with oscillatory terms in the wave function of the Universe. This enables us to solve the field equations. For a specific value of the conserved quantity, we find a closed-form solution for the Hubble factor, which is equivalent to a cosmological model in general relativity containing two perfect fluids. This provides us with different models for specific values of the parameters omega(BD), and w. Finally, the results hold for the specific case where the Brans-Dicke parameter omega(BD) is zero, that is, for the O'Hanlon massive dilaton theory and, consequently, for f(R) gravity in the metric formalism.

Non-relativistic matter and dark energy in a quantum conformal model	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2015.11.003	We consider a generalization of the Standard Model whose action displays conformal invariance in d dimensions. The model contains a strongly coupled dark matter sector which breaks conformal symmetry dynamically. The model evades conformal anomaly and leads to identically zero vacuum energy in flat space-time. Hence it does not suffer from the problem of fine tuning of the cosmological constant. We determine the contribution of non-relativistic matter to the energy-momentum tensor and determine a parameter regime in which it approximately reduces to the standard result. We show how dark energy and dark matter arises in this model. We discuss the parameter range for which the model reduces to the ACDM model and hence is consistent with observations.

Einstein-vector gravity, emerging gauge symmetry, and de Sitter bounce	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.044035	We construct a class of Einstein-vector theories where the vector field couples bilinearly to the curvature polynomials of arbitrary order in such a way that only the Riemann tensor rather than its derivative enters the equations of motion. The theories can thus be ghost free. The Ud(1) gauge symmetry may emerge in the vacuum and also in some weak-field limit. We focus on the two-derivative theory and study a variety of applications. We find that in this theory, the energy-momentum tensor of dark matter provides a position-dependent gauge-violating term to the Maxwell field. We also use the vector as an inflaton and construct cosmological solutions. We find that the expansion can accelerate without a bare cosmological constant, indicating a new candidate for dark energy. Furthermore, we obtain exact solutions of de Sitter bounce, generated by the vector which behaves like a Maxwell field at later times. We also obtain a few new exact black holes that are asymptotic to flat and Lifshitz spacetimes. In addition, we construct exact wormholes and Randall-Sundrum II domain walls.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
