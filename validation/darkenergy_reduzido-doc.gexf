				<node id="83" label="We show that a cosmology driven by gravitationally induced particle production of all nonrelativistic species existing in the present Universe mimics exactly the observed flat accelerating Lambda CDM cosmology with just one dynamical free parameter This kind of scenario includes the creation cold dark matter CCDM model 15 as a particular case and also provides a natural reduction of the dark sector since the vacuum component is not needed to accelerate the Universe The new cosmic scenario is equivalent to Lambda CDM both at the background and perturbative levels and the associated creation process is also in agreement with the universality of the gravitational interaction and equivalence principle Implicitly it also suggests that the present day astronomical observations cannot be considered the ultimate proof of cosmic vacuum effects in the evolved Universe because Lambda CDM may be only an effective cosmology"/>
				<node id="84" label="We investigate cosmological evolution in the scalartensor theory with the field derivative coupling to the doubledual of the Riemann tensor the cubictype theory The theory can be seen as the straightforward extension of the scalartensor with the quadratic order field derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor the quadratictype theory Both the field derivative couplings to the Einstein tensor and the doubledual of the Riemann tensor have been argued in terms of the successful realization of the selftuning of the cosmological constant within the Horndeski theory Assuming the constant potential given by the sum of the cosmological constant and the quantum vacuum energy the shift symmetry for the scalar field and no matter fields in the spatiallyflat FriedmannLemaitreRobertsonWalker spacetime we can reduce the set of the field equations to the firstorder ordinary nonlinear differential equation for the Hubble parameter showing the existence of the selftuned and runaway de Sitter solutions in addition to the standard de Sitter solutions in general relativity and the finite Hubble singularities which can be reached within the finite time We then argue the possible cosmological evolution in terms of the values of the effective cosmological constant the kinetic coupling constants and the initial Hubble parameter Although the behavior of the universe around each of the de Sitter solutions as well as the finite time singularities is very similar in both theories we find that the crucial difference appears in terms of no bounce or turnaround behavior across the vanishing Hubble parameter as well as no limitation for the range of the Hubble parameter in the cubictype theory"/>
				<node id="85" label="We obtain bounds for the minimum and maximum massradius ratio of a stable charged spherically symmetric compact object in a Ddimensional spacetime in the framework of general relativity and in the presence of dark energy The total energy including the gravitational component and the stability of objects with minimum massradius ratio is also investigated The minimum energy condition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged objects with minimum massradius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy only As applied to the electron in the fourdimensional case this procedure allows one to reobtain the classical electron radius from purely general relativistic considerations By combining the lower mass bound in four spacetime dimensions with minimum length uncertainty relations MLUR motivated by quantum gravity we obtain an alternative bound for the maximum chargemass ratio of a stable gravitating charged quantum mechanical object expressed in terms of fundamental constants Evaluating this limit numerically we obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the chargemass ratio of the electron as required by the stability conditions This suggests that if the electron were either less massive with the same charge or if its charge were any higher for fixed mass a combination of electrostatic and dark energy repulsion would destabilize the Compton radius In other words the electron would blow itself apart Our results suggest the existence of a deep connection between gravity the presence of the cosmological constant and the stability of fundamental particles"/>
				<node id="86" label="Models based on the YangMills condensate YMC have been advocated for in the literature and claimed as successful candidates for explaining dark energy Several variations on this simple idea have been considered the most promising of which are reviewed here Nevertheless the previously attained results relied heavily on the perturbative approach to the analysis of the effective YangMills action which is only adequate in the asymptotically free limit and were extended into a regime the infrared limit in which confinement is expected We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in theta = Fmu nua Fa mu nu2 exists a YMC forms that drives the Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase The details of the models depend weakly on the specific form of the effective YangMills Lagrangian Using nonperturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalizationgroup procedure we finally show that the minimum in theta of the effective Lagrangian exists Thus a YMC can actually take place The nonperturbative model has properties similar to the ones in the perturbative model In the early stage of the Universe the YMC equation of state has an evolution that resembles the radiation component ie wy > 13 However in the late stage wy naturally runs to the critical state with wy = 1 and the Universe transitions from a matterdominated into a dark energy dominated stage only at latest time at a redshift whose value depends on the initial conditions that are chosen while solving the dynamical system"/>
				<node id="87" label="According to Lovelocks theorem the HilbertEinstein and the Lovelock actions are indistinguishable from their field equations However they have different scalartensor counterparts which correspond to the BransDicke and the LovelockBransDicke LBD gravities respectively In this paper the LBD model of alternative gravity with the Lagrangian density LLBD = 116 piphiR + arootgRR + bG  Lomegaphi delalphaphi delalphaphi is developed where RR and G respectively denote the topological ChernPontryagin and GaussBonnet invariants The field equation the kinematical and dynamical wave equations and the constraint from energymomentum conservation are all derived It is shown that the LBD gravity reduces to general relativity in the limit Lomega > infinity unless the `topological balance condition holds and in vacuum it can be conformally transformed into the dynamical ChernSimons gravity and the generalized GaussBonnet dark energy with Horndeskilike or Galileonlike kinetics Moreover the LBD gravity allows for the latetime cosmic acceleration without dark energy Finally the LBD gravity is generalized into the Lovelockscalartensor gravity and its equivalence to fourthorder modified gravities is established It is also emphasized that the standard expressions for the contributions of generalized GaussBonnet dependence can be further simplified"/>
				<node id="88" label="Entropic cosmology assumes several forms of entropy on the horizon of the universe where the entropy can be considered to behave as if it were related to the exchange the transfer of energy To discuss this exchangeability the consistency of the two continuity equations obtained from two different methods is examined focusing on a homogeneous isotropic spatially flat and matterdominated universe The first continuity equation is derived from the first law of thermodynamics whereas the second equation is from the Friedmann and acceleration equations To study the influence of forms of entropy on the consistency a phenomenological entropicforce model is examined using a general form of entropy proportional to the nth power of the Hubble horizon In this formulation the Bekenstein entropy an area entropy the TsallisCirto blackhole entropy a volume entropy and a quartic entropy are represented by n = 2 3 and 4 respectively The two continuity equations for the present model are found to be consistent with each other especially when n = 2 ie the Bekenstein entropy The exchange of energy between the bulk the universe and the boundary the horizon of the universe should be a viable scenario consistent with the holographic principle"/>
