Big bounce, slow-roll inflation, and dark energy from conformal gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043509	We examine the cosmological sector of a gauge theory of gravity based on the SO(4,2) conformal group of Minkowski space. We allow for conventional matter coupled to the spacetime metric as well as matter coupled to the field that gauges special conformal transformations. An effective vacuum energy appears as an integration constant, and this allows us to recover the late time acceleration of the Universe. Furthermore, gravitational fields sourced by ordinary cosmological matter (i.e. dust and radiation) are significantly weakened in the very early Universe, which has the effect of replacing the big bang with a big bounce. Finally, we find that this bounce is followed by a period of nearly exponential slow roll inflation that can last long enough to explain the large scale homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background.

On the covariant formalism of the effective field theory of gravity and its cosmological implications	10.1088/1361-6382/aa549d	Following our previous work wherein the leading order effective action was computed in the covariant effective field theory of gravity, here we specialize the effective action to the FRW spacetime and obtain the effective Friedmann equations. In particular, we focus our attention on studying the cosmological implications of the non-local terms when each of them is combined with the Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain both analytical and iterative solutions to the effective background equations in all the cases and also briefly comment on the consistency between the iterative and numerical solutions whenever possible. We find that among all the non-local terms, the imprints induced by R 1/square(2) R are very significant. Interpreting these corrections as an effective dark energy component characterized by an equation of state parameter, we find that the R 1/square(2) Rcorrection can indeed lead to an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch even in the absence of a cosmological constant. We briefly discuss some phenomenological consequences of our results.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Dynamics of higher-dimensional FRW cosmology in R-p exp(lambda R) gravity	10.1007/s12043-016-1335-2	We study the cosmological dynamics for R-p exp(lambda(R)) gravity theory in the metric formalism, using dynamical systems approach. Considering higher-dimensional FRW geometries in case of an imperfect fluid which has two different scale factors in the normal and extra dimensions, we find the exact solutions, and study its behaviour and stability for both vacuum and matter cases. It is found that stable solutions corresponding to accelerated expansion at late times exist, which can describe the inflationary era of the Universe. We also study the evolution of scale factors both in the normal and extra dimensions for different values of anisotropy parameter and the number of extra dimensions for such a scenario.

Role of tilted congruence and f(R) gravity on regular compact objects	10.1103/PhysRevD.95.024024	The purpose of this paper is to check the impact of observer and Palatini f(R) terms in the formulations of inhomogeneity factors of spherical relativistic systems. We consider the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi dynamical model as a compact object and studied its evolution with both tilted and nontilted observers. We performed our analysis for particular cases of fluid distribution in tilted frame and found some energy density irregularity variables. We found that these variables are drastically different from those observed by a nontilted observer. The conformal flat dust and perfect matter contents are homogeneous as long as they impregnate vacuum core. However, this restriction is relaxed, when the complexity in the fluid description is increased. The radial fluid velocity due to tilted congruences and Palatini f(R) curvature terms tends to produce hindrances in the appearance of energy-density inhomogeneities in the initially regular spherical stellar populations.

Cosmological constant, fine structure constant and beyond	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-4581-z	In the present work, we consider the cosmological constant model , which is well motivated from three independent approaches. As is well known, the hint of varying fine structure constant was found in 1998. If is right, it means that the cosmological constant should also be varying. Here, we try to develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant , in which we view it from an interacting vacuum energy perspective. Then we consider the observational constraints on these models by using the 293 data from the absorption systems in the spectra of distant quasars. We find that the model parameters can be tightly constrained to the very narrow ranges of typically. On the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model from another perspective, namely it can be equivalent to a model containing ``dark energy{''} and ``warm dark matter{''	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Exacerbating the Cosmological Constant Problem with Interacting Dark Energy Models	10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.011302	Future cosmological surveys will probe the expansion history of the Universe and constrain phenomenological models of dark energy. Such models do not address the fine-tuning problem of the vacuum energy, i.e., the cosmological constant problem (CCP), but can make it spectacularly worse. We show that this is the case for ``interacting dark energy{''} models in which the masses of the dark matter states depend on the dark energy sector. If realized in nature, these models have far-reaching implications for proposed solutions to the CCP that require the number of vacua to exceed the fine-tuning of the vacuum energy density. We show that current estimates of the number of flux vacua in string theory, N-vac similar to O(10(272 000)), are far too small to realize certain simple models of interacting dark energy and solve the cosmological constant problem anthropically. These models admit distinctive observational signatures that can be targeted by future gamma-ray observatories, hence making it possible to observationally rule out the anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in theories with a finite number of vacua.

The complete Brans-Dicke theories	10.1016/j.aop.2016.11.013	Given that the simple wave equation of Brans-Dicke theory for the scalar field is preserved, we have investigated, through exhaustively analyzing the Bianchi identities, the consistent theories which violate the exact energy conservation equation. It is found that only three theories exist which are unambiguously determined from consistency, without imposing arbitrary functions by hand. Each of these theories possesses a specific interaction term which controls the energy exchange between the scalar field and ordinary matter. The theories contain new parameters (integration constants from the integration procedure) and when these are switched-off, Brans-Dicke theory emerges. As usually, the vacuum theories can be defined from the complete Brans-Dicke theories when the matter energy-momentum tensor vanishes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	ANNALS OF PHYSICS
Matter density perturbation and power spectrum in running vacuum model	10.1093/mnras/stw2549	We investigate the matter density perturbation delta(m) and power spectrum P(k) in the running vacuum model, with the cosmological constant being a function of the Hubble parameter, given by Lambda = Lambda(0) + 6 sigma HH0 + 3vH(2), in which the linear and quadratic terms of H would originate from the QCD vacuum condensation and cosmological renormalization group, respectively. Taking the dark energy perturbation into consideration, we derive the evolution equation for delta(m) and find a specific scale d(cr) = 2 pi/k(cr), which divides the evolution of the universe into the sub-interaction and super-interaction regimes, corresponding to k << k(cr) and k >> k(cr), respectively. For the former, the evolution of delta(m) has the same behaviour as that in the Lambda cold dark model, while for the latter, the growth of delta(m) is frozen (greatly enhanced) when nu + sigma > (<) 0 due to the couplings between radiation, matter and dark energy. It is clear that the observational data rule out the cases with nu < 0 and nu + sigma < 0, while the allowed window for the model parameters is extremely narrow with nu, vertical bar sigma vertical bar less than or similar to O(10 (7)).

Electromagnetic Casimir densities for a cylindrical shell on de Sitter space	10.1142/S0217751X16501839	Complete set of cylindrical modes is constructed for the electromagnetic field inside and outside a cylindrical shell in the background of (D + 1)-dimensional dS space-time. On the shell, the field obeys the generalized perfect conductor boundary condition. For the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, we evaluate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the electric field squared and of the energy-momentum tensor. The shell-induced contributions are explicitly extracted. In this way, for points away from the shell, the renormalization is reduced to the one for the VEVs in the boundary-free dS bulk. As a special case, the VEVs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the (D + 1)-dimensional Minkowski bulk. We show that the shell-induced contribution in the electric field squared is positive for both the interior and exterior regions. The corresponding Casimir-Polder forces are directed toward the shell. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the diagonal components, has a nonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the direction normal to the shell. This flux is directed from the shell in both the exterior and interior regions. For points near the shell, the leading terms in the asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding expressions in the Minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the proper distance in the dS bulk. The influence of the gravitational field on the local characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell larger than the dS curvature radius. The results are extended for confining boundary conditions of flux tube models in QCD.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Topological structure of the vacuum, cosmological constant and dark energy	10.1142/S0217751X16300519	In this review, we present a theory of cosmological constant and dark energy (DE), based on the topological structure of the vacuum. The multiple point principle (MPP) is reviewed. It demonstrates the existence of the two vacua into the SM. The Froggatt-Nielsen's prediction of the top-quark and Higgs masses is given in the assumption that there exist two degenerate vacua in the SM. This prediction was improved by the next-order calculations. We also considered Sidharth's theory of cosmological constant based on the noncommutative geometry of the Planck scale space-time, what gives an extremely small DE density providing the accelerating expansion of the Universe. Theory of two degenerate vacua - the Planck scale phase and electroweak (EW) phase -is also reviewed, topological defects in these vacua are investigated, also the Compton wavelength phase suggested by Sidharth is discussed. A general theory of the phase transition and the problem of the vacuum stability in the SM is reviewed. Assuming the existence of a new scalar S bound state 6t + 6 (t) over bar, earlier predicted by Froggatt, Nielsen and Laperashvili, we try to provide the vacuum stability in the SM and exact accuracy of the MPP.

Cosmological implications of DGP braneworld via well-known holographic dark energy models	10.1142/S0218271816501029	The cosmological analysis is being studied in the present work in Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld scenario by taking various interacting modified holographic dark energy (HDE) models. We discuss the various cosmological parameters such as deceleration parameter, equation-of-state (EoS) parameter and squared speed of sound. It is found that the trajectories of deceleration parameter exhibit in accelerated phase of the universe for all models. The EoS parameter corresponds to various phases of cosmic acceleration like quintessence, vacuum, phantom and also exhibits consistency with observational data. The squared speed of sound also gives stability of models in the current scenario. The omega(theta)-omega'(theta). also gives consistent results with various observational schemes. The statefinders plane also exhibits the cosmic acceleration. It is interesting to remark here that some of our results shows consistency with observational data like WMAP+CMB+BAO+H-0+SNe.

Symmetry breaking and onset of cosmic acceleration in scalar field models	10.1016/j.dark.2016.09.004	We propose a new scenario for the onset of positive acceleration of our Universe based on symmetry breaking in coupled dark energy scalar field model. In a symmetry breaking process where the scalar field rolls down its own potential, the potential reduction is not in favor of acceleration. In our model, when dark matter density becomes less than a critical value, the shape of the effective potential is changed and, the quintessence field climbs up along its own potential while rolls down the effective potential. We show that this procedure may establish the positivity of the potential required for the Universe to accelerate. In addition, we show that by choosing an appropriate interaction between dark sectors there is the possibility that the scalar field resides in a new vacuum giving rise to a positive cosmological constant which is responsible for a permanent late time acceleration.

Simple mass estimates for resonance(s) being 6 top+6 antitop bound states and combinations thereof	10.1142/S0217751X16501682	We have long speculated,(2,12,50-62) that 6 top + 6 antitop quarks due to the relatively large size of the top-Yukawa coupling would bind exceptionally strongly by mainly Higgs exchange. Here we present a surprisingly simple ``calculation{''} of the mass of this speculated bound state. Even a possible resonance in scattering of two such bound states is speculated. For the ``calculation{''} of the masses it is crucial to assume, that our since long speculated principle ``multiple point principle,{''} 5-18 is true. This principle says: there are several vacua all having almost zero energy density. Further, we make an approximation of the Higgs Yukawa potential essentially replacing the exponential in it by a step-function. The new result means that there are now two independent calls for our bound state having the mass around 750 GeV required by our ``new law of nature{''} the Multiple Point Principle. It should be remarked that in our picture there is no new physics in the sense of new fundamental particles, but the ``multiple point principle{''} is new in the sense of being not yet accepted. Further, we get the same mass within uncertainties as earlier2 but now from a completely different assumption, except for being from our ``multiple point principle.{''} But the two masses are gotten from using different (speculative) vacua occurring in the pure Standard Model.

Radiative Screening of Fifth Forces	10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.211102	We describe a symmetron model in which the screening of fifth forces arises at the one-loop level through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that such a theory can avoid current constraints on the existence of fifth forces but still has the potential to give rise to observable deviations from general relativity, which could be seen in cold atom experiments.

Gauss-Bonnet dark energy Chaplygin gas model	10.1140/epjp/i2016-16398-5	The correspondence of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) model and its modified (MGB) model of dark energy with the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas-scalar field models (SCG and GCG) have been studied in a flat universe. The exact solution of potentials and scalar fields, which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe, are reconstructed. According to the evolutionary behavior of the GB and MGB models, the same form of dynamics of scalar field and potential for different SCG and GCG models are derived. By calculating the squared sound speed of the MGB, GB model as well as the SCG, GCG, and investigating the GB-Chaplygin gas from the viewpoint of linear perturbation theory, we find that the best results, which are consistent with the observation, may appear by considering MGB-GCG. Also, we find out some bounds for parameters.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS

Cosmic anisotropic doomsday in Bianchi type I universes	10.1063/1.4967954	In this paper we study finite time future singularities in anisotropic Bianchi type I models. It is shown that there exist future singularities similar to Big Rip ones (which appear in the framework of phantom Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies). Specifically, in an ellipsoidal anisotropic scenario or in a fully anisotropic scenario, the three directional and average scale factors may diverge at a finite future time, together with energy densities and anisotropic pressures. We call these singularities ``Anisotropic Big Rip Singularities.{''} We show that there also exist Bianchi type I models filled with matter, where one or two directional scale factors may diverge. Another type of future anisotropic singularities is shown to be present in vacuum cosmologies, i.e., Kasner spacetimes. These singularities are induced by the shear scalar, which also blows up at a finite time. We call such a singularity ``Vacuum Rip.{''} In this case one directional scale factor blows up, while the other two and average scale factors tend to zero. Published by AIP Publishing.

Gravitational anti-screening as an alternative to the Lambda CDM model	10.1007/s10509-016-2953-3	Previously, in Penner (Astrophys. Space Sci., 361: 124, 2016), a theory of gravitational anti-screening was shown to lead to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relationship. In addition it was shown to agree with the observed rotation curve of the Galaxy, the observed features in the rotational curves of other spiral galaxies, and with observations of the Coma cluster. In this paper, the theory is now shown to be consistent with a geometrically flat universe. Using a model of the distribution of superclusters, the overall density parameter of the universe, as determined by the theory, is Omega = 1.08 +/- 0.19. In addition, the energy density which falls out from the theory has a negative pressure associated with it. This, along with a model of the evolution of superclusters, leads to an acceleration of the universal expansion without the requirement of dark energy. The theory of gravitational anti-screening therefore provides an alternative to the Lambda CDM model of cosmology.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Five dimensional minimally interacting holographic dark energy model in Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation	10.1007/s10509-016-2938-2	In this paper, we investigate five dimensional space-time filled with minimally interacting dark matter and holographic dark energy in Brans-Dicke (Phys. Rev. 124:925, 1961) scalar-tensor theory of gravitation. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained using (i) special law of variation for Hubble's parameter that yields constant value of deceleration parameter and (ii) a relation between metric potentials. The physical and geometrical aspects of the model are also discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
The black hole merger event GW150914 within a modified theory of general relativity	10.1093/mnras/stw1919	In 2016 February the first observation of gravitational waves were reported. The source of this event, denoted as GW150914, was identified as the merger of two black holes with about 30 solar masses each, at a distance of approximately 400 Mpc. These data were deduced using the theory of general relativity. Since 2009 a modified theory was proposed which adds near massive objects phenomenologically the contribution of a dark energy, whose origin are vacuum fluctuations. The dark energy accumulates towards smaller distances, reducing effectively the gravitational constant. In this contribution we show that as a consequence the deduces chirping mass and the luminosity distance are larger. This result suggests that the black hole merger corresponds to two massive black holes near the centre of primordial galaxies at large luminosity distance, i.e. large redshifts.

Correspondence of F(R) gravity singularities in Jordan and Einstein frames	10.1016/j.aop.2016.06.020	We study the finite time singularity correspondence between the Jordan and Einstein frames for various F(R) gravity theories. Particularly we investigate the ordinary pure F(R) gravity case and the unimodular F(R) gravity cases, in the absence of any matter fluids. In the ordinary F(R) gravity cases, by using specific illustrative examples, we show that it is possible to have various correspondences of finite time singularities, and in some cases it is possible a singular cosmology in one frame might be non-singular in the other frame. In the unimodular F(R) gravity case, the unimodular constraint is affected by the conformal transformation, so this has an effect on the metric we choose. Moreover, we study the Einstein frame counterpart theory of the unimodular F(R) gravity case, and we investigate the correspondences of the singularities in the two theories by considering specific illustrative examples. Finally, a brief dynamical system analysis is performed for the vacuum unimodular F(R) gravity and we demonstrate how the dynamical system behaves near the future Big Rip singularity.

Evolving extrinsic curvature and the cosmological constant problem	10.1088/0031-8949/91/10/105001	The concept of smooth deformation of Riemannian manifolds associated with the extrinsic curvature is explained and applied to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology. We show that such deformation can be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert-like dynamical principle may produce an observable effect in the sense of Noether. As a result, we show how the extrinsic curvature compensates both quantitative and qualitative differences between the cosmological constant. and the vacuum energy rho(vac) obtaining the observed upper bound for the cosmological constant problem at electroweak scale. The topological characteristics of the extrinsic curvature are discussed showing that the produced extrinsic scalar curvature is an evolving dynamical quantity.	PHYSICA SCRIPTA

Some physical and geometrical properties of the model are also discussed.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
About Dark Energy and Dark Matter in a Three-Dimensional Quantum Vacuum Model	10.1007/s10701-016-0021-z	A model of a three-dimensional quantum vacuum based on Planck energy density as a universal property of a granular space is suggested. The possibility to provide an unifying explanation of dark matter and dark energy as phenomena linked with the fluctuations of the three-dimensional quantum vacuum is explored. The changes and fluctuations of the quantum vacuum energy density generate a curvature of space-time similar to the curvature produced by a ``dark energy{''} density. The formation of large scale structures in the universe associated to the flattening of the orbital speeds of the spiral galaxies can be explained in terms of primary fluctuations of the quantum vacuum energy density without attracting the idea of dark matter.

EINSTEIN-CARTAN GRAVITY WITH TORSION FIELD SERVING AS AN ORIGIN FOR THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT OR DARK ENERGY DENSITY	10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/47	We analyse the Einstein-Cartan gravity in its standard form R = R + kappa(2), where. and R are the Ricci scalar curvatures in the Einstein-Cartan and Einstein gravity, respectively, and kappa(2) is the quadratic contribution of torsion in terms of the contorsion tensor kappa. We treat torsion as an external (or background) field and show that its contribution to the Einstein equations can be interpreted in terms of the torsion energy-momentum tensor, local conservation of which in a curved spacetime with an arbitrary metric or an arbitrary gravitational field demands a proportionality of the torsion energy-momentum tensor to a metric tensor, a covariant derivative of which vanishes owing to the metricity condition. This allows us to claim that torsion can serve as an origin for the vacuum energy density, given by the cosmological constant or dark energy density in the universe. This is a model-independent result that may explain the small value of the cosmological constant, which is a long-standing problem in cosmology. We show that the obtained result is valid also in the Poincare gauge gravitational theory of Kibble, where the Einstein-Hilbert action can be represented in the same form: R = R + kappa(2).

Quantum Weyl invariance and cosmology	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.06.034	Equations for cosmological evolution are formulated in a Weyl invariant formalism to take into account possible Weyl anomalies. Near two dimensions, the renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal energy-momentum tensor and a slowly decaying vacuum energy. A natural generalization to four dimensions implies a quantum modification of Einstein field equations at long distances. It offers a new perspective on time-dependence of couplings and naturalness with potentially far-reaching consequences for the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.

Running cosmological constant with observational tests	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.026	We investigate the running cosmological constant model with dark energy linearly proportional to the Hubble parameter, Lambda = sigma H + Lambda(0), in which the Lambda CDM limit is recovered by taking sigma = 0. We derive the linear perturbation equations of gravity under the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, and show the power spectra of the CMB temperature and matter density distribution. By using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we fit the model to the current observational data and find that sigma H-0/Lambda(0) less than or similar to 2.63 x 10(-2) and 6.74 x 10(-2) for Lambda(t) coupled to matter and radiation-matter, respectively, along with constraints on other cosmological parameters.

Effective cosmological constant induced by stochastic fluctuations of Newton's constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2016.07.015	We consider implications of the microscopic dynamics of spacetime for the evolution of cosmological models. We argue that quantum geometry effects may lead to stochastic fluctuations of the gravitational constant, which is thus considered as a macroscopic effective dynamical quantity. Consistency with Riemannian geometry entails the presence of a time-dependent dark energy term in the modified field equations, which can be expressed in terms of the dynamical gravitational constant. We suggest that the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe may be ascribed to quantum fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime rather than the vacuum energy from the matter sector.

Deformed matter bounce with dark energy epoch	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.064022	We extend the loop quantum cosmology matter bounce scenario in order to include a dark energy era, which ends abruptly at a rip singularity where the scale factor and the Hubble rate diverge. In the ``deformed matter bounce scenario,{''} the Universe is contracting from an initial noncausal matter dominated era until it reaches a minimal radius. After that it expands in a decelerating way, until at late times, where it expands in an accelerating way, and thus the model is described by a dark energy era that follows the matter dominated era. Depending on the choice of the free parameters of the model, the dark energy era is quintessential as what follows the matter domination era, and eventually it crosses the phantom divide line and becomes phantom. At the end of the dark energy era, a rip singularity exists, where the scale factor and Hubble rate diverge; however, the physical system cannot reach the singularity, since the effective energy density and pressure become complex. This indicates two things, first that the ordinary loop quantum cosmology matter bounce evolution stops, thus ending the infinite repetition of the ordinary matter bounce scenario. Second, the fact that both the pressure and the density become complex probably indicates that the description of the cosmic evolution within the theoretical context of loop quantum cosmology ceases to describe the physics of the system and possibly a more fundamental theory of quantum gravity is needed near the would be rip singularity. We describe the qualitative features of the model, and we also investigate how this cosmology could be realized by a viscous fluid in the context of loop quantum cosmology. In addition to this, we show how this deformed model can be realized by a canonical scalar field filled Universe, in the context of loop quantum cosmology. Finally, we demonstrate how the model can be generated by a vacuum F(R) gravity.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Starobinsky-Like Inflation and Running Vacuum in the Context of Supergravity	10.3390/universe2030014	We describe the primeval inflationary phase of the early Universe within a quantum field theoretical (QFT) framework that can be viewed as the effective action of vacuum decay in the early times. Interestingly enough, the model accounts for the ``graceful exit{''} of the inflationary phase into the standard radiation regime. The underlying QFT framework considered here is supergravity (SUGRA), more specifically an existing formulation in which the Starobinsky-type inflation (de Sitter background) emerges from the quantum corrections to the effective action after integrating out the gravitino fields in their (dynamically induced) massive phase. We also demonstrate that the structure of the effective action in this model is consistent with the generic idea of re-normalization group (RG) running of the cosmological parameters; specifically, it follows from the corresponding RG equation for the vacuum energy density as a function of the Hubble rate, rho boolean AND (H). Overall, our combined approach amounts to a concrete-model realization of inflation triggered by vacuum decay in a fundamental physics context, which, as it turns out, can also be extended for the remaining epochs of the cosmological evolution until the current dark energy era.

The effect of backreaction of non-minimally coupled massless quintom fields in FLRW universe	10.1007/s10714-016-2114-6	In this paper the quantum backreaction of non-minimally coupled massless quintom fields in FLRW universe has been discussed. quintom model contains two massless scalar fields where one of scalar fields has positive kinetic energy and another one has negative kinetic energy term. In this model, we obtain the vacuum expectation value of the full energy-momentum tensor in different cosmological eras including inflation, radiation and matter dominated eras on FRLW universe with constant epsilon. This quantity is divergent in different cases. In order to renormalize it, we separate the vacuum expectation values of the full energy-momentum tensor to the UV and IR parts by using mu cutoff. Then we eliminate the UV divergences by introducing a counterterm action and adding it to the action of the model. Also we calculate the IR part of the energy-momentum tensor during inflation and different transitions. For this purpose, we assume that the transition from one period to the next happens fast. Therefore we use a sudden transition approximation at matching time. In order to study behavior of the backreaction, we obtain the ratio of the dominant contribution of quantum energy density to the corresponding background quantity in different cosmological eras. Moreover, we show that the one-loop fluctuations of quintom model on de Sitter space give a contribution to the cosmological constant. Finally we obtain the effect of the quantum backreaction on the background geometry leading to new scale factor for cosmological eras.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Chameleon dark energy and atom interferometry	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044051	Atom interferometry experiments are searching for evidence of chameleon scalar fields with ever-increasing precision. As experiments become more precise, so too must theoretical predictions. Previous work has made numerous approximations to simplify the calculation, which in general requires solving a three-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation. This paper calculates the chameleonic force using a numerical relaxation scheme on a uniform grid. This technique is more general than previous work, which assumed spherical symmetry to reduce the partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation. We examine the effects of approximations made in previous efforts on this subject and calculate the chameleonic force in a setup that closely mimics the recent experiment of Hamilton et al. Specifically, we simulate the vacuum chamber as a cylinder with dimensions matching those of the experiment, taking into account the backreaction of the source mass, its offset from the center, and the effects of the chamber walls. Remarkably, the acceleration on a test atomic particle is found to differ by only 20\% from the approximate analytical treatment. These results allow us to place rigorous constraints on the parameter space of chameleon field theories, although ultimately the constraint we find is the same as the one we reported in Hamilton et al. because we had slightly underestimated the size of the vacuum chamber. This computational technique will continue to be useful as experiments become even more precise and will also be a valuable tool in optimizing future searches for chameleon fields and related theories.

Quantum cosmology near two dimensions	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044017	We consider a Weyl-invariant formulation of gravity with a cosmological constant in d-dimensional spacetime and show that near two dimensions the classical action reduces to the timelike Liouville action. We show that the renormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal quantum momentum tensor which satisfies the Ward identities in a nontrivial way. The resulting evolution equations for an isotropic, homogeneous universe lead to slowly decaying vacuum energy and power-law expansion. We outline the implications for the cosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Improved cosmological model	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.043508	We study a class of nonlocal, action-based, and purely gravitational models. These models seek to describe a cosmology in which inflation is driven by a large, bare cosmological constant that is screened by the self-gravitation between the soft gravitons that inflation rips from the vacuum. Inflation ends with the Universe poised on the verge of gravitational collapse, in an oscillating phase of expansion and contraction that should lead to rapid reheating when matter is included. After the attainment of a hot, dense Universe the nonlocal screening terms become constant as the Universe evolves through a conventional phase of radiation domination. The onset of matter domination triggers a much smaller antiscreening effect that could explain the current phase of acceleration.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Spherically symmetric black holes in f(R) gravity: is geometric scalar hair supported?	10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155005	We critically discuss current research on black hole (BH) solutions in f (R) gravity and shed light on its geometrical and physical significance. We also investigate the meaning, existence or lack thereof of Birkhoff's theorem (BT) in this kind of modified gravity. We then focus on the analysis and search for non-trivial (i.e. hairy) asymptotically flat (AF) BH solutions in static and spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetimes in vacuum having the property that the Ricci scalar does not vanish identically in the domain of outer communication. To do so, we provide and enforce regularity conditions at the horizon in order to prevent the presence of singular solutions there. Specifically, we consider several classes of f (R) models like those proposed recently for explaining the accelerated expansion in the Universe and which have been thoroughly tested in several physical scenarios. Finally, we report analytical and numerical evidence about the absence of geometric hair in AFSSSBH solutions in those f (R) models. First, we submit the models to the available no-hair theorems (NHTs), and in the cases where the theorems apply, the absence of hair is demonstrated analytically. In the cases where the theorems do not apply, we resort to a numerical analysis due to the complexity of the non-linear differential equations. With that aim, a code to solve the equations numerically was built and tested using well-known exact solutions. In a future investigation we plan to analyze the problem of hair in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Modified Brans-Dicke cosmology with matter-scalar field interaction	10.1088/0264-9381/33/15/155004	We discuss the cosmological implications of an extended Brans-Dicke theory presented recently, in which there is an energy exchange between the scalar field and ordinary matter, determined by the theory. A new mass scale is generated in the theory which modifies the Friedmann equations with field-dependent corrected kinetic terms. In a radiation Universe the general solutions are found and there are branches with complete removal of the initial singularity, while at the same time a transient accelerating period can occur within deceleration. Entropy production is also possible in the early Universe. In the dust era, late-times acceleration has been found numerically in agreement with the correct behavior of the density parameters and the dark energy equation of state, while the gravitational constant has only a slight variation over a large redshift interval in agreement with observational bounds.

Vacuum Cherenkov radiation and bremsstrahlung from disformal couplings	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/08/003	The simplest way to modify gravity is to extend the gravitational sector to include an additional scalar degree of freedom. The most general metric that can be built in such a theory includes disformal terms, so that standard model fields move on a metric which is the sum of the space time metric and a tensor constructed from first derivatives of the scalar. In such a theory gravitational waves and photons can propagate at different speeds, and these can in turn be different from the maximum speed limit for matter particles. In this work we show that disformal couplings can cause charged particles to emit Cherenkov radiation and bremsstrahlung apparently in vacuum, depending on the background evolution of the scalar field. We discuss the implications of this for observations of cosmic rays, and the constraints that arise for models of dark energy with disformal couplings.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
An analytic cosmology solution of Poincare gauge gravity	10.1142/S0219887816500961	A cosmology of Poincare gauge theory is developed. An analytic solution is obtained. The calculation results agree with observation data and can be compared with the Lambda CDM model. The cosmological constant puzzle is the coincidence and fine tuning problem are solved naturally at the same time. The cosmological constant turns out to be the intrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe, and is derived from the theory naturally rather than added artificially. The dark energy originates from geometry, includes the cosmological constant but differs from it. The analytic expression of the state equations of the dark energy and the density parameters of the matter and the geometric dark energy are derived. The full equations of linear cosmological perturbations and the solutions are obtained.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
Constraints from growth-rate data on some coupled dark energy models mimicking a I > CDM expansion	10.1093/mnras/stw1087	The Lambda CDM expansion can be mimicked by dark energy coupled to matter. In this case, the equation of state (w) over bar and (Q) over bar coupling of this coupled dark energy cannot be constrained by observations of the Hubble function alone. In this article, we determine the constraints on two such coupled dark energy models, considering some current and forecast Euclid-like growth-rate data and assuming the prior on the Lambda CDM dark matter density parameter today, Omega(m0) = 0.295 +/- 0.04. The first model is defined by a constant equation of state. We find that, at 2 sigma, (w) over bar = -1.02(-0.22)(+0.06) and the coupling function (Q) over bar (0) today is , (Q) over bar H-0(0)-3 = 0.057(-0.148)(+0.353), with H-0 the Hubble constant. The second model is defined by a varying equation of state (w) over bar = (w) over bar (a) - (w) over bar (b) ln(1 + z), with z the redshift and ((w) over bar (a), (w) over bar (b))two constants. We find that, at 2 sigma, \{(w) over bar (a) = -0.99(-0.90)(+0.17), (w) over bar (b) = -0.04(-1.17)(+0.31) and (Q) over bar H-0(0)-3 = 0.0002(-0.18)(+1.35)\}. These constraints on coupled dark energy agree with a Lambda CDM model but are too poor to discard with confidence coupled dark energy different from a vacuum but mimicking a Lambda CDM expansion.

Non-linear structure formation in the `Running FLRW' cosmological model	10.1093/mnras/stw1047	We present a suite of cosmological N-body simulations describing the `Running Friedmann-Lema < tre-Robertson-Walker' (R-FLRW) cosmological model. This model is based on quantum field theory in a curved space-time and extends Lambda cold dark matter (I > CDM) with a time-evolving vacuum density, I >(z), and time-evolving gravitational Newton's coupling, G(z). In this paper, we review the model and introduce the necessary analytical treatment needed to adapt a reference N-body code. Our resulting simulations represent the first realization of the full growth history of structure in the R-FLRW cosmology into the non-linear regime, and our normalization choice makes them fully consistent with the latest cosmic microwave background data. The post-processing data products also allow, for the first time, an analysis of the properties of the halo and sub-halo populations. We explore the degeneracies of many statistical observables and discuss the steps needed to break them. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative description of the deviations of R-FLRW from I > CDM, which could be readily exploited by future cosmological observations to test and further constrain the model.

New constraints on interacting dark energy from cosmic chronometers	10.1103/PhysRevD.94.023508	We use the latest compilation of observational Hubble parameter measurements estimated with the differential evolution of cosmic chronometers, in combination with the local value of the Hubble constant recently measured with 2.4\% precision, to constrain the cosmological scenario where dark energy interacts directly with the dark matter sector. To diminish the degeneracy between the parameters we additionally consider standard probes, such as supernovae type Ia from joint light-curve analysis samples, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements (BAO), and cosmic microwave background data from Planck 2015 estimations. Our analysis shows that the direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter is mildly favored, while the dark energy equation-of-state parameter is w < -1 at a 3 sigma confidence level.

Instability of Interacting Ghost Dark Energy Model in an Anisotropic Universe	10.1007/s10773-016-2961-7	A new dark energy model called ``ghost dark energy{''} was recently suggested to explain the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. This model originates from the Veneziano ghost of QCD. The dark energy density is proportional to Hubble parameter, rho (I >) = alpha H, where alpha is a constant of order and I > (Q C D) similar to 100M e V is QCD mass scale. In this paper, we investigate about the stability of generalized QCD ghost dark energy model against perturbations in the anisotropic background. At first, the ghost dark energy model of the universe with spatial BI model with/without the interaction between dark matter and dark energy is discussed. In particular, the equation of state and the deceleration parameters and a differential equation governing the evolution of this dark energy model are obtained. Then, we use the squared sound speed the sign of which determines the stability of the model. We explore the stability of this model in the presence/absence of interaction between dark energy and dark matter in both flat and non-isotropic geometry. In conclusion, we find evidence that the ghost dark energy might can not lead to a stable universe favored by observations at the present time in BI universe.

Gauss-Bonnet cosmology unifying late and early-time acceleration eras with intermediate eras	10.1007/s10509-016-2800-6	In this paper we demonstrate that with vacuum F(G) gravity it is possible to describe the unification of late and early-time acceleration eras with the radiation and matter domination era. The Hubble rate of the unified evolution contains two mild singularities, so called Type IV singularities, and the evolution itself has some appealing features, such as the existence of a deceleration-acceleration transition at late times. We also address quantitatively a fundamental question related to modified gravity models description of cosmological evolution: Is it possible for all modified gravity descriptions of our Universe evolution, to produce a nearly scale invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations? As we demonstrate, the answer for the F(G) description is no, since the resulting power spectrum is not scale invariant, in contrast to the F(R) description studied in the literature. Therefore, although the cosmological evolution can be realized in the context of vacuum F(G) gravity, the evolution is not compatible with the observational data, in contrast to the F(R) gravity description of the same cosmological evolution.

The exact Riemann solutions to the generalized Chaplygin gas equations with friction	10.1016/j.cnsns.2015.12.013	The exact solutions to the Riemann problem for the one-dimensional generalized Chaplygin gas equations with a Coulomb-like friction term are constructed explicitly. The delta shock wave arises in the Riemann solutions provided that the initial data satisfy some certain conditions, although the system is strictly hyperbolic and the two characteristic fields are genuinely nonlinear. The position, strength and propagation speed of delta shock wave are obtained from the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. It is shown that the Coulomb-like friction term make waves (including rarefaction, shock and delta shock) bend into parabolic shapes for the Riemann solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cubic derivative interactions and asymptotic dynamics of the galileon vacuum	10.1088/0264-9381/33/12/125036	In this paper we apply the tools of the dynamical systems theory in order to uncover the whole asymptotic structure of the vacuum interactions of a galileon model with a cubic derivative interaction term. It is shown that, contrary to what occurs in the presence of background matter, the galileon interactions of vacuum appreciably modify the late-time cosmic dynamics. In particular, a local late-time attractor representing phantom behavior arises which is inevitably associated with a big rip singularity. It seems that the gravitational interactions of the background matter with the galileon screen the effects of the gravitational self-interactions of the galileon, thus erasing any potential modification of the late-time dynamics by the galileon vacuum processes. Unlike other galileon models inspired in the DGP scenario, self-accelerating solutions do not arise in this model.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
General analytic solutions of scalar field cosmology with arbitrary potential	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.123518	We present the solution space for the case of a minimally coupled scalar field with arbitrary potential in a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric. This is made possible due to the existence of a nonlocal integral of motion corresponding to the conformal Killing field of the two-dimensional minisuperspace metric. Both the spatially flat and nonflat cases are studied first in the presence of only the scalar field and subsequently with the addition of noninteracting perfect fluids. It is verified that this addition does not change the general form of the solution, but only the particular expressions of the scalar field and the potential. The results are applied in the case of parametric dark energy models where we derive the scalar field equivalence solution for some proposed models in the literature.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological consequences of an adiabatic matter creation process	10.1093/mnras/stw566	In this paper, we investigate the cosmological consequences of a continuous matter creation associated with the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum. To illustrate this, three phenomenological models are considered. An equivalent scalar field description is presented for each models. The effects on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum are analysed for the first time in the context of adiabatic matter creation cosmology. Further, we introduce a model independent treatment, Om, which depends only on the Hubble expansion rate and the cosmological redshift to distinguish any cosmological model from Lambda cold dark matter by providing a null test for the cosmological constant, meaning that, for any two redshifts z(1), z(2), Om(z) is same, i.e. Om(z(1))-Om(z(2)) = 0. Also, this diagnostic can differentiate between several cosmological models by indicating their quintessential/phantom behaviour without knowing the accurate value of the matter density, and the present value of the Hubble parameter. For our models, we find that particle production rate is inversely proportional to Om. Finally, the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics bounded by the apparent horizon has been examined.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Ostrogradsky in theories with multiple fields	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/041	We review how the (absence of) Ostrogradsky instability manifests itself in theories with multiple fields. It has recently been appreciated that when multiple fields are present, the existence of higher derivatives may not automatically imply the existence of ghosts. We discuss the connection with gravitational theories like massive gravity and beyond Horndeski which manifest higher derivatives in some formulations and yet are free of Ostrogradsky ghost. We also examine an interesting new class of Extended Scalar-Tensor Theories of gravity which has been recently proposed. We show that for a subclass of these theories, the tensor modes are either not dynamical or are infinitely strongly coupled. Among the remaining theories for which the tensor modes are well-defined one counts one new model that is not field-redefinable to Horndeski via a conformal and disformal transformation but that does require the vacuum to break Lorentz invariance. We discuss the implications for the effective field theory of dark energy and the stability of the theory. In particular we find that if we restrict ourselves to the Extended Scalar-Tensor class of theories for which the tensors are well-behaved and the scalar is free from gradient or ghost instabilities on FLRW then we recover Horndeski up to field redefinitions.

Reissner-Nordstrm Anti-de Sitter Black Holes in Mimetic F (R) Gravity	10.3390/universe2020010	In this paper, we study under which conditions the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole can be a solution of the vacuum mimetic F (R) gravity with Lagrange multiplier and mimetic scalar potential. As the author demonstrates, the resulting picture in the mimetic F (R) gravity case is a trivial extension of the standard F (R) approach, and in effect, the metric perturbations in the mimetic F (R) gravity case, for the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole metric, at the first order of the perturbed variables are the same at the leading order.

Theoretical Derivation of the Cosmological Constant in the Framework of the Hydrodynamic Model of Quantum Gravity: Can the Quantum Vacuum Singularity Be Overcome?	10.3390/galaxies4020006	In the present work, it is shown that the problem of the cosmological constant (CC) is practically the consequence of the inadequacy of general relativity to take into account the quantum property of the space. The equations show that the cosmological constant naturally emerges in the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum gravity and that it does not appear in the classical limit because the quantum energy-impulse tensor gives an equal contribution with opposite sign. The work shows that a very large local value of the CC comes from the space where the mass of a quasi-punctual particle is present but that it can be as small as measured on cosmological scale. The theory shows that the small dependence of the CC from the mean mass density of the universe is due to the null contribution coming from the empty space. This fact gives some hints for the explanation of the conundrum of the cosmic coincidence by making a high CC value of the initial instant of universe compatible with the very small one of the present era.

Asymptotical null structure of an electro-vacuum spacetime with a cosmological constant	10.1142/S0218271816500863	Bondi-Sachs (BS) framework is a powerful tool to analyze the asymptotical null structure of a spacetime. Based on Bondi's outgoing boundary condition, the asymptotical null structure of an electro-vacuum spacetime without a cosmological constant has been constructed clearly. Recently more and more observations imply that the Einstein equation should be modified with an nonzero cosmological constant. It is interesting to investigate the asymptotical null structure of a spacetime with a cosmological constant. In this paper, we extend our previous result from vacuum case to electro-vacuum case. We find that the gravitational sector of the asymptotical null structure depends stronglyon the boundary conditions, while the electrical sector is independent of the boundary condition.

A note on Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in mimetic F(R) gravity	10.1142/S0218271816500784	In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime is a solution of the mimetic F(R) gravity with Lagrange multiplier and potential. As we demonstrate, the resulting mimetic F(R) gravity is a slight modification of the ordinary F(R) gravity case, however the resulting perturbation equations are not in all cases identical to the ordinary F(R) gravity case. In the latter case, the perturbation equations are identical to the ones corresponding to the Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de Sitter black hole.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Tuning the cosmological constant, broken scale invariance, unitarity	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/028	We study gravity coupled to a cosmological constant and a scale but not con formally invariant sector. In Minkowski vacuum, scale invariance is spontaneously broken. We consider small fluctuations around the Minkowski vacuum. At the linearised level we find that the trace of metric perturbations receives a positive or negative mass squared contribution. However, only for the Fierz-Pauli combination the theory is free of ghosts. The mass term for the trace of metric perturbations can be cancelled by explicitly breaking scale invariance. This reintroduces fine-tuning. Models based on four form field strength show similarities with explicit scale symmetry breaking due to quantisation conditions.

Deflation of the cosmological constant associated with inflation and dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/06/039	In order to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant, we propose a simple model with the vacuum energy non-minimally coupled to the inflaton field. In this model, the vacuum energy decays to the inflaton during pre-inflation and inflation eras, so that the cosmological constant effectively deflates from the Planck mass scale to a much smaller one after inflation and plays the role of dark energy in the late-time of the universe. We show that our deflationary scenario is applicable to arbitrary slow-roll inflation models. We also take two specific inflation potentials to illustrate our results.

Rotation of the Universe at Different Cosmological Epochs	10.1134/S1063772916040041	A step-by-step foundation for the differential character of the Universe's rotation is presented. First, invoking the concept of spacetime foam with spin, it is reasonable to assume that the very early Universe can be described by the Dirac equation. Second, it is shown using the Ehrenfest theorem that, from a classical point of view, the early Universe can be described by the Papapetrou equations. Third, it is stressed that our Universe can perform only rotational motion. It is shown based on the spin part of the Papapetrou equations that the Universe's rotation depends appreciably on the physical properties of a specific cosmological epoch. The rotational angular velocity is calculated for three basic cosmological epochs: the matter-dominated epoch, the transition period (from domination of matter to domination of vacuum), and the vacuum-dominated epoch.

The Riemann problem for the Chaplygin gas equations with a source term	10.1002/zamm.201500015	The Riemann solutions for the one-dimensional Chaplygin gas equations with a Coulomb-like friction term are constructed explicitly. It is shown that the delta shock wave appears in the Riemann solutions in some certain situations. The generalized Rankine-Hugoniot conditions of delta shock wave are established and the position, propagation speed and strength of delta shock wave are given, which enables us to see the influence of Coulomb-like friction term on the Riemann solutions for the Chaplygin gas equations clearly. In addition, the relations connected with the area transportation are derived which include mass and momentum transportation. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Reconstruction of f (T)-gravity in the absence of matter	10.1007/s10509-016-2786-0	We derive an exact f (T) gravity in the absence of ordinary matter in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, where T is the teleparallel torsion scalar. We show that vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor Tau(mu nu). of matter does not imply vanishing of the teleparallel torsion scalar, in contrast to general relativity, where the Ricci scalar vanishes. The theory provides an exponential (inflationary) scale factor independent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained f (T) acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model. Nevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open universe provides a decaying pattern of the f (T) contributing directly to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant. The equation of state (EoS) of the torsion vacuum fluid has been studied in positive and negative Hubble regimes. We study the case when the torsion is made of a scalar field (tlaplon) which acts as torsion potential. This treatment enables to induce a tlaplon field sensitive to the symmetry of the spacetime in addition to the reconstruction of its effective potential from the f (T) theory. The theory provides six different versions of inflationary models. The real solutions are mainly quadratic, the complex solutions, remarkably, provide Higgs-like potential.

Ghost Dark Energy with Non-Linear Interaction Term	10.1007/s10773-016-2919-9	Here we investigate ghost dark energy (GDE) in the presence of a non-linear interaction term between dark matter and dark energy. To this end we take into account a general form for the interaction term. Then we discuss about different features of three choices of the non-linear interacting GDE. In all cases we obtain equation of state parameter, w (D) = p/rho, the deceleration parameter and evolution equation of the dark energy density parameter (Omega (D) ). We find that in one case, w (D) cross the phantom line (w (D) < -1). However in two other classes w (D) can not cross the phantom divide. The coincidence problem can be solved in these models completely and there exist good agreement between the models and observational values of w (D) , q. We study squared sound speed , and find that for one case of non-linear interaction term can achieves positive values at late time of evolution.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Conformal Gravity rotation curves with a conformal Higgs halo	10.1093/mnras/stw506	We discuss the effect of a conformally coupled Higgs field on conformal gravity (CG) predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies. The Mannheim-Kazanas (MK) metric is a valid vacuum solution of CG's fourth-order Poisson equation if and only if the Higgs field has a particular radial profile, S(r) = S-0 a/(r + a), decreasing from S-0 at r = 0 with radial scale-length a. Since particle rest masses scale with S(r)/S-0, their world lines do not follow time-like geodesics of the MK metric g(mu nu), as previously assumed, but rather those of the Higgs-frame MKmetric (g) over tilde (mu nu). = Omega(2)g(mu nu), with the conformal factor Omega(r)= S(r)/S-0. We show that the required stretching of the MK metric exactly cancels the linear potential that has been invoked to fit galaxy rotation curves without dark matter. We also formulate, for spherical structures with a Higgs halo S(r), the CG equations that must be solved for viable astrophysical tests of CG using galaxy and cluster dynamics and lensing.

Uniformly expanding vacuum: A possible interpretation of the dark energy	10.1016/j.dark.2016.02.002	Following the spirit of the equivalence principle, we take a step further to recognize the free fall of the observer as a method to eliminate causes that would lead the perceived vacuum to change its original state. Thus, it is expected that the vacuum should be in a rigid Minkowski state or be uniformly expanding. By carefully investigating the impact on measurement caused by the expansion, we clarify the exact meaning of the uniformly expanding vacuum and find that this proposal may be able to explain the current observations of an accelerating universe.

Ultralight gravitons with tiny electric dipole moment are seeping from the vacuum		Mass and electric dipole moment (EDM) of graviton,which is identified as dark matter particle (DMP), are estimated. This change the concept of dark matter and can help to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The calculations are based on quantum modification of the general relativity (Qmoger) with two additional terms in the Einstein equations, which takes into account production/absorption of gravitons. In this theory, there are no Big Bang in the beginning (some local bangs during the evolution of the universe are probable), no critical density of the universe, no dark energy (no need in cosmological constant) and no inflation. The theory (without fitting) is in good quantitative agreement with cosmic data.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Probing modified gravity with atom-interferometry: A numerical approach	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.104036	Refined constraints on chameleon theories are calculated for atom-interferometry experiments, using a numerical approach consisting in solving for a four-region model the static and spherically symmetric Klein-Gordon equation for the chameleon field. By modeling not only the test mass and the vacuum chamber but also its walls and the exterior environment, the method allows one to probe new effects on the scalar field profile and the induced acceleration of atoms. In the case of a weakly perturbing test mass, the effect of the wall is to enhance the field profile and to lower the acceleration inside the chamber by up to 1 order of magnitude. In the thin-shell regime, results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical estimations, when measurements are realized in the immediate vicinity of the test mass. Close to the vacuum chamber wall, the acceleration becomes negative and potentially measurable. This prediction could be used to discriminate between fifth-force effects and systematic experimental uncertainties, by doing the experiment at several key positions inside the vacuum chamber. For the chameleon potential V(phi) = Lambda(4+alpha)/phi(alpha) and a coupling function A(phi) = exp(phi/M), one finds M greater than or similar to 7 x 10(16) GeV, independently of the power-law index. For V(phi) = Lambda(4)(1 + Lambda/phi), one finds M greater than or similar to 10(14) GeV. A sensitivity of a similar to 10(-11) m/s(2) would probe the model up to the Planck scale. Finally, a proposal for a second experimental setup, in a vacuum room, is presented. In this case, Planckian values of M could be probed provided that a similar to 10(-10) m/s(2), a limit reachable by future experiments. Our method can easily be extended to constrain other models with a screening mechanism, such as symmetron, dilaton and f(R) theories.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmology in Poincare gauge gravity with a pseudoscalar torsion	10.1007/JHEP05(2016)024	A cosmology of Poincare gauge theory is developed, where several properties of universe corresponding to the cosmological equations with the pseudoscalar torsion function are investigated. The cosmological constant is found to be the intrinsic torsion and curvature of the vacuum universe and is derived from the theory naturally rather than added artificially, i.e. the dark energy originates from geometry and includes the cosmological constant but differs from it. The cosmological constant puzzle, the coincidence and fine tuning problem are relieved naturally at the same time. By solving the cosmological equations, the analytic cosmological solution is obtained and can be compared with the Lambda CDM model. In addition, the expressions of density parameters of the matter and the geometric dark energy are derived, and it is shown that the evolution of state equations for the geometric dark energy agrees with the current observational data. At last, the full equations of linear cosmological perturbations and the solutions are obtained.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Vacuum energy sequestering and conformal symmetry	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/05/002	In a series of recent papers Kaloper and Padilla proposed a mechanism to sequester standard model vacuum contributions to the cosmological constant. We study the consequences of embedding their proposal into a fully local quantum theory. In the original work, the bare cosmological constant Lambda and a scaling parameter lambda are introduced as global fields. We find that in the local case the resulting Lagrangian is that of a spontaneously broken conformal field theory where lambda plays the role of the dilaton. A vanishing or a small cosmological constant is thus a consequence of the underlying conformal field theory structure.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Connecting inflation with late cosmic acceleration by particle production	10.1142/S021827181650067X	A continuous process of creation of particles is investigated as a possible connection between the inflationary stage with late cosmic acceleration. In this model, the inflationary era occurs due to a continuous and fast process of creation of relativistic particles, and the recent accelerating phase is driven by the nonrelativistic matter creation from the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum, which finally results in an effective equation of state (EoS) less than -1. Thus, explaining recent results in favor of a phantom dynamics without the need of any modifications in the gravity theory has been proposed. Finally, we confront the model with recent observational data of type Ia Supernova, history of the Hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Holographic Ricci dark energy as running vacuum	10.1142/S0217732316500759	Holographic Ricci dark energy (DE) that has been proposed ago has faced problems of future singularity. In the present work, we consider the Ricci DE with an additive constant in its density as running vacuum energy. We have analytically solved the Friedmann equations and also the role played by the general conservation law followed by the cosmic components together. We have shown that the running vacuum energy status of the Ricci DE helps to remove the possible future singularity in the model. The additive constant in the density of the running vacuum played an important role, such that, without that, the model predicts either eternal deceleration or eternal acceleration. But along with the additive constant, equivalent to a cosmological constant, the model predicts a late time acceleration in the expansion of the universe, and in the far future of the evolution it tends to de Sitter universe.

Gravitational lensing by gravastars	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.084051	As a possible method to detect gravastars (gravitational-vacuum-star), which was originally proposed by Mazur and Mottola, we study their gravitational lensing effects. Specifically, we adopt a spherical thin-shell model of a gravastar developed by Visser and Wiltshire, which connects interior de Sitter geometry and exterior Schwarzschild geometry, and assume that its surface is optically transparent. We calculate the image of a companion which rotates around the gravastar; we find that some characteristic images appear, depending on whether the gravastar possess unstable circular orbits of photons (Model 1) or not (Model 2). For Model 2, we calculate the total luminosity change, which is called microlensing effects; the maximal luminosity could be considerably larger than the black hole with the same mass.

Thermodynamical aspects of running vacuum models	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-4060-6	The thermal history of a large class of running vacuum models in which the effective cosmological term is described by a truncated power series of the Hubble rate, whose dominant term is Lambda (H) proportional to Hn+2, is discussed in detail. Specifically, by assuming that the ultrarelativistic particles produced by the vacuum decay emerge into space-time in such a way that its energy density rho(r) proportional to T-4, the temperature evolution law and the increasing entropy function are analytically calculated. For the whole class of vacuum models explored here we find that the primeval value of the comoving radiation entropy density (associated to effectively massless particles) starts from zero and evolves extremely fast until reaching a maximum near the end of the vacuum decay phase, where it saturates. The late-time conservation of the radiation entropy during the adiabatic FRW phase also guarantees that the whole class of running vacuum models predicts the same correct value of the present day entropy, S-0 similar to 10(87)-10(88) (in natural units), independently of the initial conditions. In addition, by assuming Gibbons-Hawking temperature as an initial condition, we find that the ratio between the late-time and primordial vacuum energy densities is in agreement with naive estimates from quantum field theory, namely, rho(Lambda 0/rho Lambda I) similar to 10(-123). Such results are independent on the power n and suggests that the observed Universe may evolve smoothly between two extreme, unstable, non-singular de Sitter phases.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
An interesting consequence of the general principle of relativity	10.1140/epjp/i2016-16091-9	We show that Einstein's general theory of relativity, together with the assumption that the principle of relativity encompasses rotational motion, predicts that in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe model with dust and Lorentz Invariant Vacuum Energy (LIVE), the density parameter of vacuum energy must have the value Omega(Lambda 0) = 0.737. The physical mechanism connecting the relativity of rotational motion with the energy density of dark energy is the inertial dragging effect. The predicted value is necessary in order to have perfect inertial dragging, which is required for rotational motion to be relative. If one accepts that due to the impossibility of defining motion for a single particle in an otherwise empty universe, the universe must be constructed so that all types of motion are relative, then this solves the so-called cosmological constant problem.

Matter perturbations in scaling cosmology	10.1093/mnras/stw127	A suitable nonlinear interaction between dark matter with an energy density rho(M) and dark energy with an energy density rho(X) is known to give rise to a non-canonical scaling rho(M) proportional to rho(a-xi)(X), where xi is a parameter which generally deviates from xi = 3. Here, we present a covariant generalization of this class of models and investigate the corresponding perturbation dynamics. The resulting matter power spectrum for the special case of a time-varying Lambda model is compared with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR9 catalogue (Ahn et al.). We find a best-fitting value of xi = 3.25 which corresponds to a decay of dark matter into the cosmological term. Our results are compatible with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model at the 2 sigma confidence level.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
On the smallness of the cosmological constant	10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2015.09.237	In N = 1 supergravity the scalar potential of the hidden sector may have degenerate supersymmetric (SUSY) and non-supersymmetric Minkowski vacua. In this case local SUSY in the second supersymmetric Minkowski phase can be broken dynamically. Assuming that such a second phase and the phase associated with the physical vacuum are exactly degenerate, we estimate the value of the cosmological constant. We argue that the observed value of the dark energy density can be reproduced if in the second vacuum local SUSY breaking is induced by gaugino condensation at a scale which is just slightly lower than Lambda(QCD) in the physical vacuum. The presence of a third degenerate vacuum, in which local SUSY and electroweak (EW) symmetry are broken near the Planck scale, may lead to small values of the quartic Higgs self coupling and the corresponding beta function at the Planck scale in the phase in which we live.	
Gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan space-time and gravitational interaction	10.1134/S0202289316020109	The place and physical significance of gauge gravitation theory in Riemann-Cartan spacetime (GTRC) in the framework of the gauge approach to gravitation is discussed. Isotropic cosmology built on the basis of GTRC with a general expression of the gravitational Lagrangian with indefinite parameters is considered. The most important physical consequences connected with a change of the gravitational interaction, with possible existence of limiting energy density and gravitational repulsion at extreme conditions, and also with the vacuum repulsion effect are discussed. A solution of the problem of cosmological singularity and the dark energy problem as a result of the change of the gravitational interaction is considered.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Vacuum fluctuation inside a star and their consequences for neutron stars, a simple model	10.1142/S0218301316500270	Applying semi-classical quantum mechanics, the vacuum fluctuations within a star are determined, assuming a constant mass density and applying a monopole approximation. It is found that the density for the vacuum fluctuations does not only depend linearly on the mass density, as assumed in a former publication, where neutron stars up to 6 solar masses were obtained. This is used to propose a simple model on the dependence of the dark energy to the mass density, as a function of the radial distance r. It is shown that stars with up to 200 solar masses can, in principle, be obtained. Though, we use a phenomenological model, it shows that in the presence of vacuum fluctuations stars with large masses can be stabilized and probably stars up to any mass can exist, which usually are identified as black holes.

Interaction of Gravitational field and Brans-Dicke field in R/W universe containing Dark Energy like fluid	10.1088/1674-4527/16/4/064	On studying some new models of Robertson-Walker universes with a Brans-Dicke scalar field, it is found that most of these universes contain a dark energy like fluid which confirms the present scenario of the expansion of the universe. In one of the cases, the exact solution of the field equations gives a universe with a false vacuum, while in another it reduces to that of dust distribution in the Brans-Dicke cosmology when the cosmological constant is not in the picture. In one particular model it is found that the universe may undergo a Big Rip in the future, and thus it will be very interesting to investigate such models further.

Dark energy in the three-body problem: Wide triple galaxies	10.1134/S1063772916030045	The structure and evolution of triple galaxy systems in the presence of the cosmic dark-energy background is studied in the framework of the three-body problem. The dynamics of wide triple systems are determinedmainly by the competition between the mutual gravitational forces between the three bodies and the anti-gravity created by the dark-energy background. This problem can be solved via numerical integration of the equations of motion with initial conditions that admit various types of evolutionary behavior of the system. Such dynamical models show that the anti-gravity created by dark energy makes a triple system less tightly bound, thereby facilitating its decay, with a subsequent transition to motion of the bodies away from each other in an accelerating regime with a linear Hubble-law dependence of the velocity on distance. The coefficient of proportionality between the velocity and distance in this asymptotic relation corresponds to the universal value H (I >) = 61 km s(-1) Mpc(-1), which depends only on the dark-energy density. The similarity of this relation to the large-scale recession of galaxies indicates that double and triple galaxies represent elementary dynamical cells realizing the overall behavior of a system dominated by dark energy on their own scale, independent of their masses and dimensions.

Rewriting the rules governing high intensity interactions of light with matter	10.1088/0034-4885/79/4/046401	The trajectory of discovery associated with the study of high-intensity nonlinear radiative interactions with matter and corresponding nonlinear modes of electromagnetic propagation through material that have been conducted over the last 50 years can be presented as a landscape in the intensity/quantum energy [I-h.] plane. Based on an extensive series of experimental and theoretical findings, a universal zone of anomalous enhanced electromagnetic coupling, designated as the fundamental nonlinear domain, can be defined. Since the lower boundaries of this region for all atomic matter correspond to hw similar to 10(3) eV and I approximate to 10(16) W cm(-2), it heralds a future dominated by x-ray and.-ray studies of all phases of matter including nuclear states. The augmented strength of the interaction with materials can be generally expressed as an increase in the basic electromagnetic coupling constant in which the fine structure constant alpha -> Z(2)alpha, where Z denotes the number of electrons participating in an ordered response to the driving field. Since radiative conditions strongly favoring the development of this enhanced electromagnetic coupling are readily produced in self-trapped plasma channels, the processes associated with the generation of nonlinear interactions with materials stand in natural alliance with the nonlinear mechanisms that induce confined propagation. An experimental example involving the Xe (4d(10)5s(2)5p(6)) supershell for which Z congruent to 18 that falls in the specified anomalous nonlinear domain is described. This yields an effective coupling constant of Z(2)alpha congruent to 2.4 > 1, a magnitude comparable to the strong interaction and a value rendering as useless conventional perturbative analyses founded on an expansion in powers of a. This enhancement can be quantitatively understood as a direct consequence of the dominant role played by coherently driven multiply-excited states in the dynamics of the coupling. It is also conclusively demonstrated by an abundance of data that the utterly peerless champion of the experimental campaign leading to the definition of the fundamental nonlinear domain was excimer laser technology. The basis of this unique role was the ability to satisfy simultaneously a triplet (w, I, P) of conditions stating the minimal values of the frequency., intensity I, and the power P necessary to enable the key physical processes to be experimentally observed and controllably combined. The historical confluence of these developments creates a solid foundation for the prediction of future advances in the fundamental understanding of ultra-high power density states of matter. The atomic findings graciously generalize to the composition of a nuclear stanza expressing the accessibility of the nuclear domain. With this basis serving as the launch platform, a cadenza of three grand challenge problems representing both new materials and new interactions is presented for future solution; they are (1) the performance of an experimental probe of the properties of the vacuum state associated with the dark energy at an intensity approaching the Schwinger/Heisenberg limit, (2) the attainment of amplification in the gamma-ray region (similar to 1 MeV) and the discovery of a nuclear excimer, and (3) the determination of a path to the projected super-heavy nuclear island of stability.

Anisotropic universe with magnetized dark energy	10.1007/s10509-016-2708-1	In the present work we have searched the existence of the late time acceleration of the Universe filled with cosmic fluid and uniform magnetic field as source of matter in anisotropic Heckmann-Schucking space-time. The observed acceleration of universe has been explained by introducing a positive cosmological constant. in the Einstein's field equation which is mathematically equivalent to vacuum energy with equation of state (EOS) parameter set equal to -1. The present values of the matter and the dark energy parameters (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda)) 0 are estimated in view of the latest 287 high red shift (0.3 <= z <= 1.4) SN Ia supernova data's of observed apparent magnitude along with their possible error taken from Union 2.1 compilation. It is found that the best fit value for (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda)) 0 are 0.2820 & 0.7177 respectively which are in good agreement with recent astrophysical observations in the latest surveys like WMAP [2001-2013], Planck [latest 2015] & BOSS. Various physical parameters such as the matter and dark energy densities, the present age of the universe and deceleration parameter have been obtained on the basis of the values of (Omega(m)) 0 & (Omega(Lambda))(0). Also we have estimated that the acceleration would have begun in the past at z = 0.71131 similar to 6.2334 Gyrs before from present.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Bounding f(R) gravity by particle production rate	10.1142/S021827181630010X	Several models of f(R) gravity have been proposed in order to address the dark side problem in cosmology. However, these models should be constrained also at ultraviolet scales in order to achieve some correct fundamental interpretation. Here, we analyze this possibility comparing quantum vacuum states in given f(R) cosmological backgrounds. Specifically, we compare the Bogolubov transformations associated to different vacuum states for some f(R) models. The procedure consists in fixing the f(R) free parameters by requiring that the Bogolubov coefficients can be correspondingly minimized to be in agreement with both high redshift observations and quantum field theory predictions. In such a way, the particle production is related to the value of the Hubble parameter and then to the given f(R) model. The approach is developed in both metric and Palatini formalism.

Neutron limit on the strongly-coupled chameleon field	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.062001	The physical origin of the dark energy that causes the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe is one of the major open questions of cosmology. One set of theories postulates the existence of a self-interacting scalar field for dark energy coupling to matter. In the chameleon dark energy theory, this coupling induces a screening mechanism such that the field amplitude is nonzero in empty space but is greatly suppressed in regions of terrestrial matter density. However measurements performed under appropriate vacuum conditions can enable the chameleon field to appear in the apparatus, where it can be subjected to laboratory experiments. Here we report the most stringent upper bound on the free neutron-chameleon coupling in the strongly coupled limit of the chameleon theory using neutron interferometric techniques. Our experiment sought the chameleon field through the relative phase shift it would induce along one of the neutron paths inside a perfect crystal neutron interferometer. The amplitude of the chameleon field was actively modulated by varying the millibar pressures inside a dual-chamber aluminum cell. We report a 95\% confidence level upper bound on the neutron-chameleon coupling beta ranging from beta < 4.7 x 10(6) for a Ratra-Peebles index of n = 1 in the nonlinear scalar field potential to beta < 2.4 x 10(7) for n = 6, one order of magnitude more sensitive than the most recent free neutron limit for intermediate n. Similar experiments can explore the full parameter range for chameleon dark energy in the foreseeable future.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Quantum Yang-Mills Dark Energy	10.3390/universe2010004	In this short review, I discuss basic qualitative characteristics of quantum non-Abelian gauge dynamics in the non-stationary background of the expanding Universe in the framework of the standard Einstein-Yang-Mills formulation. A brief outlook of existing studies of cosmological Yang-Mills fields and their properties will be given. Quantum effects have a profound impact on the gauge field-driven cosmological evolution. In particular, a dynamical formation of the spatially-homogeneous and isotropic gauge field condensate may be responsible for both early and late-time acceleration, as well as for dynamical compensation of non-perturbative quantum vacua contributions to the ground state of the Universe. The main properties of such a condensate in the effective QCD theory at the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background will be discussed within and beyond perturbation theory. Finally, a phenomenologically consistent dark energy can be induced dynamically as a remnant of the QCD vacua compensation arising from leading-order graviton-mediated corrections to the QCD ground state.

Locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with vacuum energy density and magnetic field in general relativity	10.1139/cjp-2015-0691	A locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type I massive string cosmological model with vacuum energy density (A) and magnetic field is investigated. To get a deterministic model of the universe, we assume that shear (sigma) is proportional to expansion (theta) and A similar to 1/R-2 as considered by Chen and Wu (Phys. Rev. D, 41, 695 (1990)) where R is a scale factor. We find that the total energy density (rho), the particle density rho(p) decreases with time. The strong energy conditions as given by Hawking and Ellis (The large scale structure of space-time. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. p. 88. (1974)) are satisfied. The vacuum energy density decreases with time, which matches with astronomical observation. The model in general represents anisotropic space-time because of the presence of strings. The total energy density and string tension density decrease because of the presence of a magnetic field. Both the models have point-type singularities at T = 0 and tau = 0, respectively. The other physical aspects of the models are also discussed.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Is Lambda CDM an effective CCDM cosmologdy?	10.1088/1475-7516/2016/03/027	We show that a cosmology driven by gravitationally induced particle production of all non-relativistic species existing in the present Universe mimics exactly the observed flat accelerating Lambda CDM cosmology with just one dynamical free parameter. This kind of scenario includes the creation cold dark matter (CCDM) model [15] as a particular case and also provides a natural reduction of the dark sector since the vacuum component is not needed to accelerate the Universe. The new cosmic scenario is equivalent to Lambda CDM both at the background and perturbative levels and the associated creation process is also in agreement with the universality of the gravitational interaction and equivalence principle. Implicitly, it also suggests that the present day astronomical observations cannot be considered the ultimate proof of cosmic vacuum effects in the evolved Universe because Lambda CDM may be only an effective cosmology.

Cosmological evolution with the cubic order field derivative coupling	10.1007/s10714-016-2025-6	We investigate cosmological evolution in the scalar-tensor theory with the field derivative coupling to the double-dual of the Riemann tensor (the cubic-type theory). The theory can be seen as the straightforward extension of the scalar-tensor with the quadratic order field derivative coupling to the Einstein tensor (the quadratic-type theory). Both the field derivative couplings to the Einstein tensor and the double-dual of the Riemann tensor have been argued in terms of the successful realization of the self-tuning of the cosmological constant within the Horndeski theory. Assuming the constant potential given by the sum of the cosmological constant and the quantum vacuum energy, the shift symmetry for the scalar field and no matter fields, in the spatially-flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, we can reduce the set of the field equations to the first-order ordinary nonlinear differential equation for the Hubble parameter, showing the existence of the self-tuned and runaway de Sitter solutions, in addition to the standard de Sitter solutions in general relativity and the finite Hubble singularities which can be reached within the finite time. We then argue the possible cosmological evolution in terms of the values of the effective cosmological constant, the kinetic coupling constants and the initial Hubble parameter. Although the behavior of the universe around each of the de Sitter solutions as well as the finite time singularities is very similar in both theories, we find that the crucial difference appears in terms of no bounce or turnaround behavior across the vanishing Hubble parameter as well as no limitation for the range of the Hubble parameter in the cubic-type theory.

The minimum mass of a charged spherically symmetric object in D dimensions, its implications for fundamental particles, and holography	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-3948-5	We obtain bounds for the minimum and maximum mass/radius ratio of a stable, charged, spherically symmetric compact object in a D-dimensional space-time in the framework of general relativity, and in the presence of dark energy. The total energy, including the gravitational component, and the stability of objects with minimum mass/radius ratio is also investigated. The minimum energy condition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged objects with minimum mass/radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy only. As applied to the electron in the four-dimensional case, this procedure allows one to re-obtain the classical electron radius from purely general relativistic considerations. By combining the lower mass bound, in four space-time dimensions, with minimum length uncertainty relations (MLUR) motivated by quantum gravity, we obtain an alternative bound for the maximum charge/mass ratio of a stable, gravitating, charged quantum mechanical object, expressed in terms of fundamental constants. Evaluating this limit numerically, we obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratio of the electron, as required by the stability conditions. This suggests that, if the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if its charge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic and dark energy repulsion would destabilize the Compton radius. In other words, the electron would blow itself apart. Our results suggest the existence of a deep connection between gravity, the presence of the cosmological constant, and the stability of fundamental particles.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Yang-Mills condensate as dark energy: A nonperturbative approach	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043012	Models based on the Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) have been advocated for in the literature and claimed as successful candidates for explaining dark energy. Several variations on this simple idea have been considered, the most promising of which are reviewed here. Nevertheless, the previously attained results relied heavily on the perturbative approach to the analysis of the effective Yang-Mills action, which is only adequate in the asymptotically free limit, and were extended into a regime, the infrared limit, in which confinement is expected. We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in theta = -F-mu nu(a) F-a mu nu/2 exists, a YMC forms that drives the Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase. The details of the models depend weakly on the specific form of the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian. Using nonperturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalization-group procedure, we finally show that the minimum in theta of the effective Lagrangian exists. Thus, a YMC can actually take place. The nonperturbative model has properties similar to the ones in the perturbative model. In the early stage of the Universe, the YMC equation of state has an evolution that resembles the radiation component, i.e., w(y) -> 1/3. However, in the late stage, wy naturally runs to the critical state with w(y) = -1, and the Universe transitions from a matter-dominated into a dark energy dominated stage only at latest time, at a redshift whose value depends on the initial conditions that are chosen while solving the dynamical system.

Lovelock-Brans-Dicke gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/33/4/045001	According to Lovelock's theorem, the Hilbert-Einstein and the Lovelock actions are indistinguishable from their field equations. However, they have different scalar-tensor counterparts, which correspond to the Brans-Dicke and the Lovelock-Brans-Dicke (LBD) gravities, respectively. In this paper the LBD model of alternative gravity with the Lagrangian density L-LBD = 1/16 pi[phi(R + a/root-g{*}RR + bG) - L-omega/phi del(alpha)phi del(alpha)phi] is developed, where {*}RR and G respectively denote the topological Chern-Pontryagin and Gauss-Bonnet invariants. The field equation, the kinematical and dynamical wave equations, and the constraint from energy-momentum conservation are all derived. It is shown that the LBD gravity reduces to general relativity in the limit L-omega -> infinity unless the `topological balance condition' holds, and in vacuum it can be conformally transformed into the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity and the generalized Gauss-Bonnet dark energy with Horndeski-like or Galileon-like kinetics. Moreover, the LBD gravity allows for the late-time cosmic acceleration without dark energy. Finally, the LBD gravity is generalized into the Lovelock-scalar-tensor gravity, and its equivalence to fourth-order modified gravities is established. It is also emphasized that the standard expressions for the contributions of generalized Gauss-Bonnet dependence can be further simplified.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
General form of entropy on the horizon of the universe in entropic cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043530	Entropic cosmology assumes several forms of entropy on the horizon of the universe, where the entropy can be considered to behave as if it were related to the exchange (the transfer) of energy. To discuss this exchangeability, the consistency of the two continuity equations obtained from two different methods is examined, focusing on a homogeneous, isotropic, spatially flat, and matter-dominated universe. The first continuity equation is derived from the first law of thermodynamics, whereas the second equation is from the Friedmann and acceleration equations. To study the influence of forms of entropy on the consistency, a phenomenological entropic-force model is examined, using a general form of entropy proportional to the nth power of the Hubble horizon. In this formulation, the Bekenstein entropy (an area entropy), the Tsallis-Cirto black-hole entropy (a volume entropy), and a quartic entropy are represented by n = 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The two continuity equations for the present model are found to be consistent with each other, especially when n = 2, i.e., the Bekenstein entropy. The exchange of energy between the bulk (the universe) and the boundary (the horizon of the universe) should be a viable scenario consistent with the holographic principle.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Classical and quantum solutions in Brans-Dicke cosmology with a perfect fluid	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.043528	We consider the application of group invariant transformations in order to constrain a flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model, containing a Brans-Dicke scalar field and a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state parameter w, where the latter is not interacting with the scalar field in the gravitational action integral. The requirement that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation be invariant under one-parameter point transformations provides us with two families of power-law potentials for the Brans-Dicke field, in which the powers are functions of the Brans-Dicke parameter omega(BD) and the parameter w. The existence of the Lie symmetry in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is equivalent to the existence of a conserved quantity in field equations and with oscillatory terms in the wave function of the Universe. This enables us to solve the field equations. For a specific value of the conserved quantity, we find a closed-form solution for the Hubble factor, which is equivalent to a cosmological model in general relativity containing two perfect fluids. This provides us with different models for specific values of the parameters omega(BD), and w. Finally, the results hold for the specific case where the Brans-Dicke parameter omega(BD) is zero, that is, for the O'Hanlon massive dilaton theory and, consequently, for f(R) gravity in the metric formalism.

Non-relativistic matter and dark energy in a quantum conformal model	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2015.11.003	We consider a generalization of the Standard Model whose action displays conformal invariance in d dimensions. The model contains a strongly coupled dark matter sector which breaks conformal symmetry dynamically. The model evades conformal anomaly and leads to identically zero vacuum energy in flat space-time. Hence it does not suffer from the problem of fine tuning of the cosmological constant. We determine the contribution of non-relativistic matter to the energy-momentum tensor and determine a parameter regime in which it approximately reduces to the standard result. We show how dark energy and dark matter arises in this model. We discuss the parameter range for which the model reduces to the ACDM model and hence is consistent with observations.

Einstein-vector gravity, emerging gauge symmetry, and de Sitter bounce	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.044035	We construct a class of Einstein-vector theories where the vector field couples bilinearly to the curvature polynomials of arbitrary order in such a way that only the Riemann tensor rather than its derivative enters the equations of motion. The theories can thus be ghost free. The Ud(1) gauge symmetry may emerge in the vacuum and also in some weak-field limit. We focus on the two-derivative theory and study a variety of applications. We find that in this theory, the energy-momentum tensor of dark matter provides a position-dependent gauge-violating term to the Maxwell field. We also use the vector as an inflaton and construct cosmological solutions. We find that the expansion can accelerate without a bare cosmological constant, indicating a new candidate for dark energy. Furthermore, we obtain exact solutions of de Sitter bounce, generated by the vector which behaves like a Maxwell field at later times. We also obtain a few new exact black holes that are asymptotic to flat and Lifshitz spacetimes. In addition, we construct exact wormholes and Randall-Sundrum II domain walls.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
A complete cosmological scenario from f(R, T-phi) gravity theory	10.1140/epjc/s10052-016-3912-4	Recent elaborated by Harko et al., the f(R, T) theories of gravity allow one to contemplate an optimistic alternative to dark energy, for which R and T stand for the Ricci scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. Although the literature has shown that the T dependence on the gravitational part of the action - which is due to the consideration of quantum effects - may induce some novel features in the scope of late-time cosmological dynamics, in the radiation-dominated universe, when T = 0, no contributions seem to arise from such theories. Apparently, f(R, T) contributions to a radiation-dominated universe may arise only from the f(R, T-phi) approach, which is nothing but the f(R, T) gravity in the case of a self-interacting scalar field whose trace of the energy-momentum tensor is T-phi. We intend, in this article, to show how f(R, T-phi) theories of gravity can contribute to the study of the primordial stages of the universe. Our results predict a graceful exit from an inflationary stage to a radiation-dominated era. They also predict a late-time cosmic acceleration after a matter-dominated phase, enabling the f(R, T-phi) theories to describe, in a self-consistent way, all the different stages of the dynamics of the universe.

Exploring plane-symmetric solutions in f(R) gravity	10.1134/S106377611601009X	The modified theories of gravity, especially the f(R) gravity, have attracted much attention in the last decade. This paper is devoted to exploring plane-symmetric solutions in the context of metric f(R) gravity. We extend the work on static plane-symmetric vacuum solutions in f(R) gravity already available in the literature [1, 2]. The modified field equations are solved using the assumptions of both constant and nonconstant scalar curvature. Some well-known solutions are recovered with power-law and logarithmic forms of f(R) models.	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL PHYSICS

Two non-vacuum solutions have been determined by using constant Ricci scalar assumption. Moreover, for some specific choices of f (R) models, the energy distribution of these solutions has been explored by applying the generalized Landau-Lifshitz energy-momentum complex in the context of f (R) theory of gravity. In addition, we discuss the stability conditions for these solutions.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Unification of dark energy and dark matter based on the Petrov classification and space-time symmetry	10.1142/S0217751X16410050	The Petrov classification of stress-energy tensors provides a model-independent definition of a vacuum by the algebraic structure of its stress-energy tensor and implies the existence of vacua whose symmetry is reduced as compared with the maximally symmetric de Sitter vacuum associated with the Einstein cosmological term. This allows to describe a vacuum in general setting by dynamical vacuum dark fluid, presented by a variable cosmological term with the reduced symmetry which makes vacuum dark fluid essentially anisotropic and allows it to be evolving and clustering. The relevant regular solutions to the Einstein equations describe regular cosmological models with time-evolving and spatially inhomogeneous vacuum dark energy, and compact vacuum objects generically related to a dark energy through the de Sitter vacuum interior: regular black holes, their remnants and self-gravitating vacuum solitons - which can be responsible for observational effects typically related to a dark matter. The mass of objects with de Sitter interior is generically related to vacuum dark energy and to breaking of space-time symmetry.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
A Lorentz gauge theory of gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/33/2/025008	We present a Lorentz gauge theory of gravity in which the metric is not dynamical. Spherically symmetric weak field solutions are studied. We show that this solution contains the Schwarzschild spacetime at least to the first order of perturbation. Next, we present a special case of the theory where the Schwarzschild metric is an exact solution. It is also shown that the de Sitter space is an exact vacuum solution of this special case and as a result the theory is able to explain the expansion of the universe with no need for dark energy. Within this special case, quantization of the theory is also studied, the basic Feynman diagrams are derived and the renormalizability of the theory is studied using the power-counting method. We show that under a certain condition the theory is power-counting renormalizable.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Testing models of vacuum energy interacting with cold dark matter	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.023002	We test the models of vacuum energy interacting with cold dark matter and try to probe the possible deviation from the Lambda CDM model using current observations. We focus on two specific models, Q = 3 beta H rho(Lambda) and Q = 3 beta H rho(c). The data combinations come from the Planck 2013 data, the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements, the type-Ia supernovae data, the Hubble constant measurement, the redshift space distortions data and the galaxy weak lensing data. For the Q = 3 beta H rho(c) model, we find that it can be tightly constrained by all the data combinations, while for the Q = 3 beta H rho(Lambda) model, there still exist significant degeneracies between parameters. The tightest constraints for the coupling constant are beta = -0.026(-0.053)(+0.036) (for Q = 3 beta H rho(Lambda)) and beta = -0.00045 +/- 0.00069 (for Q = 3 beta H rho(c)) at the 1 sigma level. For all the fit results, we find that the null interaction beta = 0 is always consistent with data. Our work completes the discussion on the interacting dark energy model in the recent Planck 2015 papers. Considering this work together with the Planck 2015 results, it is believed that there is no evidence for the models beyond the standard Lambda CDM model from the point of view of possible interaction.

Regge calculus models of closed lattice universes	10.1103/PhysRevD.93.023502	This paper examines the behavior of closed ``lattice universes{''} wherein masses are distributed in a regular lattice on the Cauchy surfaces of closed vacuum universes. Such universes are approximated using a form of Regge calculus originally developed by Collins and Williams to model closed Friedmann-Lemaitre- Robertson-Walker universes. We consider two types of lattice universes, one where all masses are identical to each other and another where one mass gets perturbed in magnitude. In the unperturbed universe, we consider the possible arrangements of the masses in the Regge Cauchy surfaces and demonstrate that the model will only be stable if each mass lies within some spherical region of convergence. We also briefly discuss the existence of Regge models that are dual to the ones we have considered. We then model a perturbed lattice universe and demonstrate that the model's evolution is well behaved, with the expansion increasing in magnitude as the perturbation is increased.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
EUCLID mirrors and test collimator AMOS developments	10.1117/12.2234265	EUCLID is an optical/near-infrared survey mission to be launched in 2020 towards the L2 Lagrange point. It will aim at studying the dark universe and providing a better understanding of the origin of the accelerating expansion of the universe. Through the use of cosmological sounding, it will investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of large structures formation. The EUCLID payload module (PLM) consists of a 1.2 m-class telescope and will accommodate two instruments. As a subcontractor of AIRBUS Defence & Space, AMOS is responsible for the manufacturing of the secondary and the tertiary mirrors of the telescope as well as for the flat folding mirror set within the focal plane arrangement of EUCLID telescope, which incorporates dedicated filtering functions. AMOS produces in addition the 1.3 m-class test collimator for the on-ground validation of the EUCLID instrument.	"ADVANCES IN OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR TELESCOPES AND

Dark Matter and Dark Energy Induced by Condensates	10.1155/2016/8089142	It is shown that the vacuum condensate induced by many phenomena behaves as a perfect fluid which, under particular conditions, has zero or negative pressure. In particular, the condensates of thermal states of fields in curved space and of mixed particles have been analyzed. It is shown that the thermal states with the cosmic microwave radiation temperature and the Unruh and the Hawking radiations give negligible contributions to the critical energy density of the universe, while the thermal vacuum of the intercluster medium could contribute to the dark matter, together with the vacuum energy of fields in curved space-time and of mixed neutrinos. Moreover, a component of the dark energy can be represented by the vacuum of axion-like particles mixed with photons and superpartners of neutrinos. The formal analogy among the systems characterized by the condensates can open new scenarios in the possibility of detecting the dark components of the universe in table top experiments.

Is Cold Dark Matter a Vacuum Effect?		Current theories about the Universe based on an FLRW model conclude that it is composed of similar to 4\% normal matter, similar to 28 \% dark matter and similar to 68\% Dark Energy which is responsible for the well-established accelerated expansion: this model works extremely well. As the Universe expands the density of normal and dark matter decreases while the proportion of Dark Energy increases. This model assumes that the amount of dark matter, whose nature at present is totally unknown, has remained constant. This is a natural assumption if dark matter is a particle of some kind - WIMP, sterile neutrino, lightest supersysmmetric particle or axion, etc. - that must have emerged from the early high temperature phase of the Big Bang. This paper proposes that dark matter is not a particle such as these but a vacuum effect, and that the proportion of dark matter in the Universe is actually increasing with time. The idea that led to this suggestion was that a quantum process (possibly the Higgs mechanism) might operate in the nilpotent vacuum that Rowlands postulates is a dual space to the real space where Standard Model fundamental fermions (and we) reside. This could produce a vacuum quantum state that has mass, which interacts gravitationally, and such states would be `dark matter'. It is proposed that the rate of production of dark matter by this process might depend on local circumstances, such as the density of dark matter and/or normal matter. This proposal makes the testable prediction that the ratio of baryonic to dark matter varies with redshift and offers an explanation, within the framework of Rowlands' ideas, of the coincidence problem - why has cosmic acceleration started in the recent epoch at redshift z similar to 0.55 when the Dark Energy density first became equal to the matter density?. This process also offers a potential solution to the `missing baryon' problem.	UNIFIED FIELD MECHANICS: NATURAL SCIENCE BEYOND THE VEIL OF SPACETIME
Using atom interferometry to detect dark energy	10.1080/00107514.2015.1060058	We review the tantalising prospect that the first evidence for the dark energy driving the observed acceleration of the universe on giga-parsec scales may be found through metre scale laboratory-based atom interferometry experiments. To do that, we first introduce the idea that scalar fields could be responsible for dark energy and show that in order to be compatible with fifth force constraints, these fields must have a screening mechanism which hides their effects from us within the solar system. Particular emphasis is placed on one such screening mechanism known as the chameleon effect where the field's mass becomes dependent on the environment. The way the field behaves in the presence of a spherical source is determined and we then go on to show how in the presence of the kind of high vacuum associated with atom interferometry experiments, and when the test particle is an atom, it is possible to use the associated interference pattern to place constraints on the acceleration due to the fifth force of the chameleon field - this has already been used to rule out large regions of the chameleon parameter space and maybe one day will be able to detect the force due to the dark energy field in the laboratory.

The Effect of de-Sitter Like Background on Increasing the Zero Point Budget of Dark Energy	10.1155/2016/2594189	During this work, using subtraction renormalization mechanism, zero point quantum fluctuations for bosonic scalar fields in a de-Sitter like background are investigated. By virtue of the observed value for spectral index, n(s)(k), for massive scalar field the best value for the first slow roll parameter, epsilon, is achieved. In addition, the energy density of vacuum quantum fluctuations for massless scalar field is obtained. The effects of these fluctuations on other components of the universe are studied. By solving the conservation equation, for some different examples, the energy density for different components of the universe is obtained. In the case which all components of the universe are in an interaction, the different dissipation functions, (Q) over tilde (i), are considered. The time evolution of rho(DE)(z)/rho(crl)(z) shows that (Q) over tilde = 3 gamma H(t)rho(m) has the best agreement in comparison to observational data including CMB, BAO, and SNeIa data set.

ABOUT A THREE-DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM VACUUM AS THE ULTIMATE ORIGIN OF GRAVITY, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, DARK ENERGY ... AND QUANTUM BEHAVIOR	10.15407/ujpe61.05.0413	A unification model where matter is a structure of energy of a three-dimensional quantum vacuum and diminishes its energy density is proposed. Mass and gravity are carried by variable energy density of the three-dimensional quantum vacuum. Electric field and magnetic field are carried by regions of polarized quantum vacuum generated by appropriate oscillations depending on fluctuations of the quantum vacuum energy density. The quantum behavior of matter derives directly from elementary energy fluctuations of the three-dimensional quantum vacuum. Dark energy is itself energy of the three-dimensional quantum vacuum.

Cosmological model favored by the holographic principle	10.1142/S2010194516601277	We present a regular spherically symmetric cosmological model of the Lemaitre class distinguished by the holographic principle as the thermodynamically stable end-point of quantum evaporation of the cosmological horizon. A source term in the Einstein equations connects smoothly two de Sitter vacua with different values of cosmological constant and corresponds to anisotropic vacuum dark fluid defined by symmetry of its stress-energy tensor which is invariant under the radial boosts. Global structure of space-time is the same as for the de Sitter space-time. Cosmological evolution goes from a big initial value of the cosmological constant towards its presently observed value.

The observational Hubble Space Telescope data are shown to be well described in RGT by a model similar to the Chernin-Baryshev-Teerikorpi model constructed in general relativity, with the local Hubble constant being smaller than the cosmological Hubble constant. A stringent constraint has been placed on the quintessence parameter, 0 <= nu <= 0.05.	PHYSICS OF PARTICLES AND NUCLEI LETTERS

Thus, the nonrelativistic dust, the false vacuum, the CMB radiation and the stiff matter cases are discussed in order to see the behavior of the Universe characterized by each matter source alone.

Thermal Condensate Structure and Cosmological Energy Density of the Universe	10.1155/2016/3127597	The aim of this paper is to study thermal vacuum condensate for scalar and fermion fields. We analyze the thermal states at the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and we show that the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor density of photon fields reproduces the energy density and pressure of the CMB. We perform the computations in the formal framework of the Thermo Field Dynamics. We also consider the case of neutrinos and thermal states at the temperature of the neutrino cosmic background. Consistency with the estimated lower bound of the sum of the active neutrino masses is verified. In the boson sector, nontrivial contribution to the energy of the universe is given by particles of masses of the order of 10(-4) eV compatible with the ones of the axion-like particles. The fractal self-similar structure of the thermal radiation is also discussed and related to the coherent structure of the thermal vacuum.	ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Dark energy and inflation in a gravitational wave dominated universe	10.1134/S0202289316010126	The empty space (with no matter fields) is not really empty because of natural metric fluctuations, quantum (gravitons) and classical (gravitational waves). We show that gravitons as well as classical gravitational waves of super-horizon wavelengths are able to form a de Sitter state of the empty homogeneous isotropic Universe. This state is an exact solution to the self-consistent equations of finite one-loop quantum gravity for gravitons in the empty FLRW space. It is also an exact solution to the selfconsistent equations of back-reaction for classical gravitational waves in the same space. Technically, to get this de Sitter solution in both quantum and classical cases, it is necessary to carry out a transition to imaginary time and then to return to real time, which is possible because this de Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick rotation. Such a procedure means that time was used as a complex variable, and this fact has a deep but still not understood significance. The de Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty Universe naturally explains the origin of dark energy and inflation because the Universe is empty at the start (inflation) and by the end (dark energy) of its evolution. This theory is consistent with the existing observational data. The CMB anisotropy of the order of 10(-5) is produced by fluctuations in the number of gravitons. The existence of a threshold and a unique coincidence of topologically impenetrable barriers for tunneling takes place for the matter-dominated epoch and de Sitter State only. These facts provide a solution to the coincidence problem. The theoretical prediction that the equation-of-state parameter should be w > -1 for inflation and w < -1 for dark energy is consistentwith the observational data. To provide the reader with a complete picture, this paper gather together new and some published results of the graviton theory of the origin of inflation and dark energy.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Flat Friedmann cosmologies with stiff fluid in Einstein-Cartan theory	10.1134/S0202289316010060	Flat Friedmann cosmologies with stiff fluid are considered in the framework of the Einstein-Cartan theory. The version of this theory which simultaneously takes into consideration two sources of torsion, namely, a perfect fluid with the vacuum equation of state and a nonminimally coupled scalar field, is studied. It is demonstrated that, for bouncing models, phantom cosmologies with and without a Big Rip singularity are possible. Singular expanding models are presented where the early stages are dominated by a scalar-torsion field which behaves as an ultrastiff fluid, while the late stages are dominated by a perfect fluid which causes a de Sitter asymptotic. Some cosmological consequences of two sources of torsion are discussed.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Curvature correction to vacuum fluctuations and cosmic evolution with cosmological duality	10.1134/S0202289316010096	The curvature correction to the Lagrangian of vacuum fluctuations is studied. After a brief tour through the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor aOE (c) T (mu nu) > and comparing this with the semiclassical averaging value of T (mu nu) , it is found that vacuum polarization due to curvature determines the effective cosmological constant and the gravitational constant in such a way that the quantum corrections of order R (2) are inevitable in the high curvature regime. Considering the asymptotic past and future as vacuum states of the Universe, a Cosmological Duality Conjecture (CDC) is put forward that ``if there are terms proportional to R (n) (n > 0), there are also terms proportional to R (-m) (m > 0) in the gravitational Lagrangian.{''} The CDC indicates a cyclic cosmological evolution where the late-time dark energy phase comes to an end and a collapsing phase begins with reversal of the arrow of time.

Noether symmetries in f(G) gravity	10.1134/S1063776116010192	We explore Noether symmetries of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe model in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for both vacuum and nonvacuum (dust fluid) cases. We evaluate symmetry generators and the corresponding conserved quantities by using separation of variables and a power-law form. We construct exact f(G) models and study accelerating expansion of the universe in terms of a scale factor, deceleration, and the EoS parameters. We also check the validity of energy conditions through the weak energy conditions for our constructed model. The state finder parameters indicate the resemblance of our constructed models to the I > CDM model. We conclude that our results are consistent with the recent astrophysical observations.

Simplified gravitational collapse with an interacting vacuum energy density	10.1007/s10714-015-2005-2	The gravitational collapse of a spherical core, in which the fluid component interact with a growing vacuum energy density, filling an homogeneous and isotropic geometry with an arbitrary curvature parameter, is investigated. The complete set of exact solutions for all values of the free parameters are obtained, and the influence of the curvature term on the collapsing time, black hole mass and other physical quantities are also discussed in detail. We show that for the same initial conditions the total black hole mass depends only on the effective matter density parameter (including the vacuum component). It is also shown that the analytical condition to form a black hole, i.e. the formation of an apparent horizon, is not altered by the contribution of the curvature terms, however, the remaining physical quantities are quantitatively modified.

Scalar field cosmology modified by the generalized uncertainty principle	10.1088/0264-9381/32/24/245006	We consider quintessence scalar field cosmology in which the Lagrangian of the scalar field is modified by the generalized uncertainty principle. We show that the perturbation terms that arise from the deformed algebra are equivalent with the existence of a second scalar field, where the two fields interact in the kinetic part. Moreover, we consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, and we derive the gravitational field equations. We show that the modified equation of state parameter w(GUP) can cross the phantom divide line; that is w(GUP) < -1. Furthermore, we derive the field equations in the dimensionless parameters, the dynamical system that arises is a singular perturbation system in which we study the existence of the fixed points in the slow manifold. Finally, we perform numerical simulations for some well known models and we show that for these models with the specific initial conditions, the parameter wGUP crosses the phantom barrier.

Existence and disappearance of conical singularities in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi theories	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.124060	In a class of Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi theories, we derive both vacuum and interior Schwarzs-child solutions under the condition that the derivatives of a scalar field phi with respect to the radius r vanish. If the parameter alpha(H) characterizing the deviation from Horndeski theories approaches a nonzero constant at the center of a spherically symmetric body, we find that the conical singularity arises at r = 0 with the Ricci scalar given by R = -2 alpha(H)/r(2). This originates from violation of the geometrical structure of four-dimensional curvature quantities. The conical singularity can disappear for the models in which the parameter alpha(H) vanishes in the limit that r -> 0. We propose explicit models without the conical singularity by properly designing the classical Lagrangian in such a way that the main contribution to alpha(H) comes from the field derivative phi'(r) around r = 0. We show that the extension of covariant Galileons with a diatonic coupling allows for the recovery of general relativistic behavior inside a so-called Vainshtein radius. In this case, both the propagation of a fifth force and the deviation from Horndeski theories are suppressed outside a compact body in such a way that the model is compatible with local gravity experiments inside the solar system.

Geometrical constraint on curvature with BAO experiments	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.123518	The spatial curvature (K or Omega(K)) is one of the most fundamental parameters of an isotropic and homogeneous universe and has a close link to the physics of the early Universe. Combining the radial and angular diameter distances measured via the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) experiments allows us to unambiguously constrain the curvature. The method is primarily based on the metric theory, and is less sensitive to the theory of structure formation (other than the existence of the BAO scale) and is free of any model of dark energy. In this paper, we estimate a best achievable accuracy of constraining the curvature with the BAO experiments. We show that an all-sky, cosmic-variance-limited galaxy survey covering the Universe up to z greater than or similar to 4 enables a precise determination of the curvature to an accuracy of sigma(Omega(K)) similar or equal to 10(-3). When we assume a model of dark energy-either the cosmological constraint or the (w(0), w(a)) model-it can achieve a precision of sigma(Omega(K)) similar or equal to a few x 10(-4). These forecasts require a high sampling density of galaxies, and are degraded by up to a factor of a few for a survey with a finite number density of similar to 10(-3) (h/Mpc)(3).	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

We focus our investigation on the behavior of the vacuum F(G) theory near the type IV singular bouncing point and address the stability of the resulting solution by treating the equations of motion as a dynamical system. In addition, we investigate how the scalar perturbations of the background metric evolve, emphasizing cosmological times near the type IV singular bouncing point. Finally, we also investigate which mimetic vacuum F(G) gravity can describe the singular bounce cosmology.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Conformal cylindrically symmetric spacetimes in modified gravity	10.1142/S0217732315502028	We investigate cylindrically symmetric spacetimes in the context of f(R) gravity. We firstly attain conformal symmetry of the cylindrically symmetric spacetime. We obtain solutions to use features of the conformal symmetry, field equations and their solutions for cylindrically symmetric spacetime filled with various cosmic matters such as vacuum state, perfect fluid, anisotropic fluid, massive scalar field and their combinations. With the vacuum state solutions, we show that source of the spacetime curvature is considered as Casimir effect. Casimir force for given spacetime is found using Wald's axiomatic analysis. We expose that the Casimir force for Boulware, Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacuum states could have attractive, repulsive and ineffective features. In the perfect fluid state, we show that matter form of the perfect fluid in given spacetime must only be dark energy. Also, we offer that potential of massive and massless scalar field are developed as an exact solution from the modified field equations. All solutions of field equations for vacuum case, perfect fluid and scalar field give a special f(R) function convenient to Lambda-CDM model. In addition to these solutions, we introduce conformal cylindrical symmetric solutions in the cases of different f(R) models. Finally, geometrical and physical results of the solutions are discussed.

Thermodynamics of universe with a varying dark energy component	10.1142/S0218271815500984	We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe filled by a dark energy (DE) candidate together with other possible sources which may include the baryonic and nonbaryonic matters. Thereinafter, we consider a situation in which the cosmos sectors do not interact with each other. By applying the unified first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of the FRW universe, we show that the DE candidate may modify the apparent horizon entropy and thus the Bekenstein limit. Moreover, we generalize our study to the models in which the cosmos sectors have a mutual interaction. Our final result indicates that the mutual interaction between the cosmos sectors may add an additional term to the apparent horizon entropy leading to modify the Bekenstein limit. Relationships with previous works have been addressed throughout the paper. Finally, we investigate the validity of the second law of thermodynamics and its generalized form in the interacting and noninteracting cosmoses.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Background history and cosmic perturbations for a general system of self-conserved dynamical dark energy and matter	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/12/048	We determine the Hubble expansion and the general cosmic perturbation equations for a general system consisting of self-conserved matter, rho(m), and self-conserved dark energy (DE), rho(D). While at the background level the two components are non-interacting, they do interact at the perturbations level. We show that the coupled system of matter and DE perturbations can be transformed into a single, third order, matter perturbation equation, which reduces to the (derivative of the) standard one in the case that the DE is just a cosmological constant. As a nontrivial application we analyze a class of dynamical models whose DE density rho(D)(H) consists of a constant term, C-0, and a series of powers of the Hubble rate. These models were previously analyzed from the point of view of dynamical vacuum models, but here we treat them as self-conserved DE models with a dynamical equation of state. We fit them to the wealth of expansion history and linear structure formation data and compare their fit quality with that of the concordance ACDM model. Those with C-0 = 0 include the so-called ``entropic-force{''} and ``QCD-ghost{''} DE models, as well as the pure linear model rho(D) similar to H, all of which appear strongly disfavored. The models with C-0 not equal 0, in contrast, emerge as promising dynamical DE candidates whose phenomenological performance is highly competitive with the rigid A-term inherent to the ACDM.

Bounce inflation cosmology with Standard Model Higgs boson	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/12/019	It is of great interest to connect cosmology in the early universe to the Standard Model of particle physics. In this paper, we try to construct a bounce inflation model with the standard model Higgs boson, where the one loop correction is taken into account in the effective potential of Higgs field. In this model, a Galileon term has been introduced to eliminate the ghost mode when bounce happens. Moreover, due to the fact that the Fermion loop correction can make part of the Higgs potential negative, one naturally obtains a large equation of state(EoS) parameter in the contracting phase, which can eliminate the anisotropy problem. After the bounce, the model can drive the universe into the standard higgs inflation phase, which can generate nearly scale-invariant power spectrum.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Growth index of matter perturbations in running vacuum models	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.123501	We derive for the first time the growth index of matter perturbations of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy depends on redshift. A particularly well-motivated model of this type is the so-called quantum field vacuum, in which, apart from a leading constant term Lambda(0), there is also an H-2 dependence in the functional form of the vacuum, namely, Lambda(H) = Lambda(0) + 3 nu(H-2 - H-0(2)). Since vertical bar nu vertical bar << 1, this form endows the vacuum energy of a mild dynamics which affects the evolution of the main cosmological observables at the background and perturbation levels. Specifically, at the perturbation level, we find that the growth index of the running vacuum cosmological model is gamma (Lambda H) approximate to 6+3 nu/11-12 nu, and thus it nicely extends analytically the result of the Lambda CDM model, gamma(Lambda) approximate to 6/11.

Evolution of vacuum fluctuations of an ultra-light massive scalar field generated during and before inflation	10.1093/ptep/ptv150	We consider an ultra-light scalar field with a mass comparable to (or lighter than) the Hubble parameter of the present universe, and calculate the time evolution of the energy-momentum tensor of the vacuum fluctuations generated during and before inflation until the late-time radiation-dominated and matter-dominated universe. The equation of state changes from w = 1/3 in the early universe to w = -1 at present, and it can give a candidate for the dark energy that we observe today. It then oscillates between w = -1 and 1 with the amplitude of the energy density decaying as a(-3). If the fluctuations are generated during ordinary inflation with the Hubble parameter H-I less than or similar to 10(-5) M-Pl, where M-Pl is the reduced Planck scale, we need a very large e-folding number N greater than or similar to 10(12) to explain the present dark energy of the order of 10(-3) eV. If a Planckian universe with a large Hubble parameter H-P similar to M-Pl existed before the ordinary inflation, an e-folding number N similar to 240 of the Planckian inflation is sufficient.

Puzzles of dark energy in the Universe-phantom	10.1088/0143-0807/36/6/065017	This paper is devoted to some simple approach based on general physics tools to describe the physical properties of a hypothetical particle which can be the source of dark energy in the Universe known as phantom. Phantom is characterized by the fact that it possesses negative momentum and kinetic energy and that it gives dominant negative pressure which acts as antigravity. We consider a phantom harmonic oscillator in comparison to a standard harmonic oscillator. By using the first law of thermodynamics we explain why the energy density of the Universe grows when it is filled with phantom. We also show how the collision of phantom with a standard particle leads to extraction of energy from the former by the latter (i.e. from phantom to the standard) if their masses are different. The most striking of our conclusions is that the collision of phantom and standard particles of the same mass is impossible unless both of them are at rest and suddenly start moving with opposite velocities and kinetic energies. This effect is a classic analog of quantum mechanical particle pair creation in a strong electric field or physical vacuum.	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
THE DARK ENERGY CAMERA	10.1088/0004-6256/150/5/150	The Dark Energy Camera is a new imager with a 2 degrees.2 diameter field of view mounted at the prime focus of the Victor M. Blanco 4 m telescope on Cerro Tololo near La Serena, Chile. The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five-element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a charge-coupled device (CCD) focal plane of 250 mu m thick fully depleted CCDs cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k x 4k CCDs for imaging and 12 2k x 2k CCDs for guiding and focus. The CCDs have 15 mu m x 15 mu m pixels with a plate scale of 0 `'.263 pixel(-1). A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6-9 electron. readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
Dynamical emergence of the Universe into the false vacuum	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/11/035	We study how the hot Universe evolves and acquires the prevailing vacuum state, demonstrating that in specific conditions which are believed to apply, the Universe becomes frozen into the state with the smallest value of Higgs vacuum field v = < h >, even if this is not the state of lowest energy. This supports the false vacuum dark energy Lambda-model. Under several likely hypotheses we determine the temperature in the evolution of the Universe at which two vacuua v(1), v(2) can swap between being true and false. We evaluate the dynamical surface pressure on domain walls between low and high mass vaccua due to the presence of matter and show that the low mass state remains the preferred vacuum of the Universe.

Cosmological constraints and cosmic growth factor for ghost dark energy models in varying G theories	10.1007/s10509-015-2534-x	The Ghost Dark Energy (GDE) model in varying Newton's gravitational coupling (VG) theories is investigated. We first obtain the cosmological parameters of the model in modified FRW cosmology with varying G and then study the growth of matter perturbations in this formalism. Applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and using the recent observational data, including Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), the cluster X-ray Gas Mass Fraction (XGMF), Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB), Growth Function for matter perturbation (GF), type Ia supernova (SNIa) and Hubble data, constraint results on GDE model parameters in VG theory are: Omega(0m) = 0.2751(-0.0104-0.0195)(+0.0104+0.0208), Omega(0d) = 0.7093(-0.0128-0.0245)(+0.0123+0.0229), beta = -0.0156-(+ 0.0041+0.0082)(0.0042-0.0078) and H-0 = 67.444(-0.873-1.829)+(0.899+1.757). The results for concordance Lambda CDM model are: Omega(0m) = 0.2762(-0.0099-0.0188)(+0.0097+0.0196), Omega(0d) = 0.7238(-0.0097-0.0196)(+0.0099+0.0188), and H-0 = 70.265(-0.797-1.515)(+0.797+1.575). We show that in this model the universe begins to accelerate at redshift z(t) similar or equal to 0.4 consistently in 1s level with observations. It shows that the growth rate of this model is well fitted by observational growth data as the Lambda CDM model.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Variable cosmological term Lambda(t)	10.1007/s10509-015-2528-8	We present the case of time-varying cosmological term Lambda(t). The main idea arises by proposing that as in the cosmological constant case, the scalar potential is identified as V(phi) = 2 Lambda, with. a constant, this identification should be kept even when the cosmological term has a temporal dependence, i.e., V (phi(t)) = 2 Lambda(t). We use the Lagrangian formalism for a scalar field phi with standard kinetic energy and arbitrary potential V (phi) and apply this model to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology. Exact solutions of the field equations are obtained by a special ansatz to solve the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equation and a particular potential for the scalar field and barotropic perfect fluid. We present the evolution on this cosmological term with different scenarios.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Dark energy models through nonextensive Tsallis' statistics	10.1016/j.physa.2015.05.002	The accelerated expansion of the Universe is one of the greatest challenges of modern physics. One candidate to explain this phenomenon is a new field called dark energy. In this work we have used the Tsallis nonextensive statistical formulation of the Friedmann equation to explore the Barboza-Alcaniz and Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parametric dark energy models and the Wang-Meng and Dalal vacuum decay models. After that, we have discussed the observational tests and the constraints concerning the Tsallis nonextensive parameter. Finally, we have described the dark energy physics through the role of the q-parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
Thermodynamic analysis of universes with the initial and final de Sitter eras	10.1142/S0217732315501588	Our aim is studying the thermodynamics of cosmological models including initial and final de Sitter eras. For this propose, bearing Cai-Kim temperature in mind, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a dark energy (DE) candidate with variable energy density, and show that the state parameter of this dark energy candidate (omega(D)) should obey the omega(D) not equal -1 constraint, whiles there is no interaction between the fluids filled the universe, and the universe is not in the de Sitter eras. Additionally, based on the thermal fluctuation theory, we study the possibility of inducing fluctuations to the entropy of the DE candidate due to a mutual interaction between the cosmos sectors. Therefore, we find a relation between the thermal fluctuations and the mutual interaction between the cosmos sectors, whiles the DE candidate has a varying energy density. Finally, bearing the coincidence problem in mind, we derive a constraint on the vacuum energy, and investigate its relation with the entropy evolution of the DE candidate. We also point to a model with initial and final de Sitter eras in which a gravitationally induced particle production process leads to change the expansion eras, whiles the corresponding pressure is considered as the cause of current accelerated phase. We study its thermodynamics, and show that such processes may also leave thermal fluctuations into the system. We also find an expression between the thermal fluctuations and the particle production rate. Finally, we use Hayward-Kodama temperature to get a relation for the horizon entropy in models including the gravitationally induced particle production process. Our study shows that the first law of thermodynamics is available on the apparent horizon whiles, the gravitationally induced particle production process, as the DE candidate, may add an additional term to the Bekenstein limit of the horizon. The relation between the validity of the second law of thermodynamics and the gravitationally particle production process is also studied.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Dark energy from the gravity vacuum	10.1088/0264-9381/32/19/195005	We propose a new solution to the cosmological constant problem building on a nonperturbative quantum theory of gravity with torsional instantons. These pseudoparticles, which were recently found to exist in a first order formulation of Giddings-Strominger axionic gravity, carry nontrivial Nieh-Yan topological charge. The nonperturbative ground state as generated due to tunneling effects is shown to be stable under quantum fluctuations. Within this framework, the associated vacuum angle, namely the Barbero-Immirzi topological parameter, gets fixed to a numerical value determined by the Hubble constant.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Cosmology and short-distance gravity	10.1142/S0218271815440034	If the observed dark-energy density rho Lambda is interpreted as the net contribution of the energy density of the vacuum, rho Lambda equivalent to rho V similar to M-V(4), and the corresponding vacuum length scale lambda(V) = M-V(-1) as the cutoff scale controlling the low-energy, effective field-theory limit of gravity, it follows that the conventional cosmological scenario based on the effective gravitational equations may be valid only up to the TeV energy scale. Such a possibility would be strongly disfavored by the existence of a relic background of primordial gravitational radiation of intensity compatible with present (or near future) experimental sensitivities.

Accelerating universe as a result of an adjustment mechanism	10.1142/S0218271815440186	In this essay, we propose that the theory of gravity's vacuum is described by a de Sitter geometry. Under this assumption, we consider an adjustment mechanism able to screen any value of the vacuum energy of the matter fields. We discuss the most general scalar-tensor cosmological models with second-order equations of motion that have a fixed de Sitter critical point for any kind of material content. These models give rise to interesting cosmological evolutions that we shall discuss.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Riding gravity away from doomsday	10.1142/S0218271815440046	The discovery that most of the energy density in the universe is stored in the form of dark energy has profound consequences for our future. In particular, our current limited understanding of quantum theory of gravity indicates that some time in the future, our universe will undergo a phase transition that will destroy us and everything else around us instantaneously. However, the laws of gravity also suggest a way out - some of our descendants could survive this catastrophe by riding gravity away from the danger. This paper describes the tale of this escape from doomsday.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
The cosmological constant and entropy problems: Mysteries of the present with profound roots in the past	10.1142/S0218271815440277	An accelerated universe should naturally have a vacuum energy density determined by its dynamical curvature. The cosmological constant (CC) is most likely a temporary description of a dynamical variable that has been drastically evolving from the early inflationary era to the present. In this essay, we propose a unified picture of the cosmic history implementing such an idea, in which the CC problem is fixed at early times. All the main stages, from inflation and its ({''}graceful{''}) exit into a standard radiation regime, as well as the matter and dark energy epochs, are accounted for. Finally, we show that for a generic grand unified theory (GUT) associated to the inflationary phase, the amount of entropy generated from primeval vacuum decay can explain the huge measured value today.

Bianchi type-III models with anisotropic dark energy in Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory	10.1007/s10509-015-2494-1	In this paper, we consider the Bianchi type-III metric (which is a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic) in the framework of a newly proposed Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory of gravitation by Carames et al. (Eur. Phys. J. C 74: 3145, 2014). In this scenario, we obtain the generalized form of the anisotropy parameter of the expansion, the dynamically anisotropic equation of state parameter, and a dynamical energy density in the presence of a single diagonal imperfect fluid. By assuming the anisotropy of the fluid, and exponential and power-law volumetric expansions, we find the exact solutions of the Brans-Dicke-Rastall field equations. We examine the isotropy of the fluid, of space, and of the expansion of the universe. It is observed that the universe can approach the isotropy monotonically even in the presence of an anisotropic fluid. We also note that the strong anisotropy observed in RG, respectively, is diminished considerably in the Rastall theory and Brans-Dicke-Rastall theory because of the influence of the parameters lambda(Ras) and omega(BD).

Study of a quadratic redshift-based correction in f(R) gravity with Baryonic matter	10.1142/S0218271815500911	This paper is considered as a second-order redshift-based corrections in derivative of modified gravitational action, f(R), to explain the late time acceleration which is appeared by Supernova Type Ia (SNeIa) without considering the dark components. Here, we obtained the cosmological dynamic parameters of universe for this redshift depended corrections. Next, we used the recent data of SNeIa Union2, shift parameter of the cosmic background radiation, Baryon acoustic oscillation from sloan digital sky survey (SDSS), and combined analysis of these observations to put constraints on the parameters of the selected F(z) model. It is very interesting that the well-known age problem of the three old objects for combined observations can be alleviated in this model. Finally, the reference action will be constructed in terms of its Taylor expansion. Also, we show that the reconstructed action definitely pass the solar system and stability of the cosmological solution tests.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Examining the viability of phantom dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.063019	In the standard cosmological framework of the 0th-order Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric and the use of perfect fluids in the stress-energy tensor, dark energy with an equation-of-state parameter w < -1 (known as phantom dark energy) implies negative kinetic energy and vacuum instability when modeled as a scalar field. However, the accepted values for present-day w from Planck and WMAP9 include a significant range of values less than -1. We find that it is not as obvious as one might think that phantom dark energy has negative kinetic energy categorically. Analogously, we find that field models of quintessence dark energy (w(phi) > -1) do not necessarily have positive kinetic energy categorically. Staying within the confines of observational constraints and general relativity, for which there is good experimental validation, we consider a few reasonable departures from the standard 0th-order framework in an attempt to see if negative kinetic energy can be avoided in these settings despite an apparent w < -1. We consider a more accurate description of the universe through the perturbing of the isotropic and homogeneous FLRW metric and the components of the stress-energy tensor, and we consider dynamic w and primordial isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations. We find that phantom dark energy does not necessarily have negative kinetic energy for all relevant length scales at all times, and we also find that, by the same token, quintessence dark energy does not necessarily have positive kinetic energy for all relevant length scales at all times.

Wormholes and naked singularities in Brans-Dicke cosmology	10.1088/0264-9381/32/18/185002	We perform an analytical and numerical study of static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of the Brans-Dicke-like cosmological model by Elizalde et al (2004 Phys. Rev. D 70 043539) with an exponential potential. In this model the phantom regime arises without the appearance of any ghost degree of freedom due to the specific form of coupling. For certain parameter ranges the model contains a regular solution that we interpret as a wormhole in an otherwise de Sitter Universe. We put several bounds on the parameter values: omega < 0, alpha(2)/vertical bar omega vertical bar < 10(-5), 22.7 less than or similar to phi(0) less than or similar to 25. The numerical solution could mimic the Schwarzschild one, so the original model is consistent with astrophysical and cosmological observational data. However, differences between our solution and the Schwarzschild one can be quite large, so black hole candidate observations could probably place further limits on the f0 value.

HINTS OF DYNAMICAL VACUUM ENERGY IN THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE	10.1088/2041-8205/811/1/L14	Recently there have been claims of model-independent evidence of dynamical dark energy. Herein we consider a fairly general class of cosmological models with a time-evolving cosmological term of the form Lambda(H) = C-0 + CHH2 + C-(H) over dot(H) over dot. where H is the Hubble rate. These models are well motivated from the theoretical point of view since they can be related to the general form of the effective action of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Consistency with matter conservation can be achieved by letting the Newtonian coupling G change very slowly with the expansion. We solve these dynamical vacuum models and fit them to the wealth of expansion history and linear structure formation data. The results of our analysis indicate a significantly better agreement as compared to the concordance Lambda CDM model, thus supporting the possibility of a dynamical cosmic vacuum.

Large-scale structure and integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1093/mnras/stv1443	The concordance particle creation model - a class of Lambda(t) Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies - is studied using large-scale structure (LSS) formation, with particular attention to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The evolution of the gravitational potential and the amplitude of the cross-correlation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal with LSS surveys are calculated in detail. We properly include in our analysis the peculiarities involving the baryonic dynamics of the Lambda(t)CDM model which were not included in previous works. Although both the Lambda(t)CDM and the standard cosmology are in agreement with available data for the CMB-LSS correlation, the former presents a slightly higher signal which can be identified with future data.

Buchdahl-Bondi limit in modified gravity: Packing extra effective mass in relativistic compact stars	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.064002	We generalize the Buchdahl-Bondi limit for the case of static, spherically symmetric, relativistic compact stars immersed in Schwarzschild vacuum in the f(R)-theory of gravity, subject to very generic regularity, thermodynamic stability, and matching conditions. Similar to the case of general relativity, our result is model independent and remains true for any physically realistic equation of state of standard stellar matter. We show that an extramassive stable star can exist in these theories, with a surface redshift larger than 2, which is forbidden in general relativity. This result gives a novel and interesting observational test for validity or otherwise of general relativity and also provides a possible solution to the dark matter problem.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
A closer look at interacting dark energy with statefinder hierarchy and growth rate of structure	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/09/024	We investigate the interacting dark energy models by using the diagnostics of statefinder hierarchy and growth rate of structure. We wish to explore the deviations from Lambda CDM and to differentiate possible degeneracies in the interacting dark energy models with the geometrical and structure growth diagnostics. We consider two interacting forms for the models, i.e., Q(1) = beta H rho(c) and Q(2) = beta H rho(de), with beta being the dimensionless coupling parameter. Our focus is the I Lambda CDM model that is a one-parameter extension to Lambda CDM by considering a direct coupling between the vacuum energy (A) and cold dark matter (CDM), with the only additional parameter beta. But we begin with a more general case by considering the IwCDM model in which dark energy has a constant w (equation-of-state parameter). For calculating the growth rate of structure, we employ the ``parametrized post-Friedmann{''} theoretical framework for interacting dark energy to numerically obtain the epsilon(z) values for the models. We show that in both geometrical and structural diagnostics the impact of w is much stronger than that of beta in the IwCDM model. We thus wish to have a closer look at the I Lambda CDM model by combining the geometrical and structural diagnostics. We find that the evolutionary trajectories in the S-3((1))-epsilon plane exhibit distinctive features and the departures from Lambda CDM could be well evaluated, theoretically, indicating that the composite null diagnostic \{S-3((1))-epsilon\} is a promising tool for investigating the interacting dark energy models. We also compare our results with the observed uncertainties on diagnostic parameters. We find that current observations still do not have sufficient precisions to completely distinguish I Lambda CDM models from the Lambda CDM model. Anyway, our work points out what precisions of measurements should be achieved to distinguish the I Lambda CDM models from the Lambda CDM model.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Fine tuning may not be enough	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/09/022	We argue that the fine tuning problems of scalar-driven inflation may be worse than is commonly believed. The reason is that reheating requires the inflaton to be coupled to other matter fields whose vacuum fluctuations alter the inflaton potential. The usual response has been that even more fine-tuning of the classical potential V(phi) can repair any damage done in this way. We point out that the effective potential in de Sitter background actually depends in a complicated way upon the dimensionless combination of phi/H. We also show that the factors of H which occur in de Sitter do not even correspond to local functionals of the metric for general geometries, nor are they Planck-suppressed.

An explanation for the tiny value of the cosmological constant and the low vacuum energy density	10.1007/s10714-015-1939-8	The paper aims to provide an explanation for the tiny value of the cosmological constant and the low vacuum energy density to represent the dark energy. To accomplish this, we will search for a fundamental principle of symmetry in space-time by means of the elimination of the classical idea of rest, by including an invariant minimum limit of speed in the subatomic world. Such a minimum speed, unattainable by particles, represents a preferred reference frame associated with a background field that breaks down the Lorentz symmetry. The metric of the flat space-time shall include the presence of a uniform vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological length scales. Thus, the equation of state for the cosmological constant [p(pressure)= -epsilon (energy density)] naturally emerges from such a space-time with an energy barrier of a minimum speed. The tiny values of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density will be successfully obtained, being in agreement with the observational results of Perlmutter, Schmidt and Riess.

Atom-interferometry constraints on dark energy	10.1126/science.aaa8883	If dark energy, which drives the accelerated expansion of the universe, consists of a light scalar field, it might be detectable as a ``fifth force{''} between normal-matter objects, in potential conflict with precision tests of gravity. Chameleon fields and other theories with screening mechanisms, however, can evade these tests by suppressing the forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber, we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the field with individual atoms rather than with bulk matter. We thereby constrained a wide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration.	SCIENCE
Cosmic microwave background radiation temperature in a dissipative universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043507	The relationship between the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature and the redshift, i.e., the T - z relation, is examined in a phenomenological dissipative model. The model contains two constant terms, as if a nonzero cosmological constant. and a dissipative process are operative in a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat universe. The T - z relation is derived from a general radiative temperature law, as appropriate for describing nonequilibrium states in a creation of cold dark matter model. Using this relation, the radiation temperature in the late Universe is calculated as a function of a dissipation rate ranging from (mu) over tilde = 0, corresponding to a nondissipative lambda cold dark matter model, to (mu) over tilde = 1, corresponding to a fully dissipative creation of cold dark matter model. The T - z relation for (mu) over tilde = 0 is linear for standard cosmology and is consistent with observations. However, with increasing dissipation rate (mu) over tilde , the radiation temperature gradually deviates from a linear law because the effective equation-of-state parameter varies with time. When the background evolution of the Universe agrees with a fine-tuned pure lambda cold dark matter model, the T - z relation for low (mu) over tilde matches observations, whereas the T -z relation for high (mu) over tilde does not. Previous work also found that a weakly dissipative model accords with measurements of a growth rate for clustering related to structure formations. These results imply that low dissipation is likely for the Universe. The weakly dissipative model should be further constrained by recent observations.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

Using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, we investigate the behavior of the scale factor for vacuum, matter, and dark energy-dominated eras. In particular, we focus on the inflationary behavior of the early Universe. Moreover, we study the perturbation analysis of this model in order to confront the inflation under consideration with observational results.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY

For this purpose, the Lagrangian of teleparallel theory is extended to a more general form by replacing the torsion scalar with an arbitrary function of it. Furthermore, considering cosmological perturbations, we explicitly calculate energy distribution associated with the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Finally, we discuss also the coupling case between matter and gravity in the context of teleparallel modified theory.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION

We have examined a cosmological scenario proposing expansion anisotropy sigma/theta to be suitable function of average scale factor S in the background of homogeneous, anisotropic Bianchi type V space-time. The models isotropize asymptotically and the presence of shear viscosity accelerates the isotropization. Our models describe a unified expansion history of the universe indicating initial decelerating expansion and late time accelerating phase consistent with observations.

Boundary effect of anomaly-induced action	10.1103/PhysRevD.92.024035	We discuss the boundary effect of anomaly-induced action in two-dimensional spacetime, which is ignored in previous studies. Anomaly-induced action, which gives the stress tensor with the same trace as the trace anomaly, can be represented in terms of local operators by introducing an auxiliary scalar field. Although the degrees of freedom of the auxiliary field can in principle describe the quantum states of the original field, the principal relation between them was unclear. We show here that, by considering the boundary effect, the solutions of classical auxiliary fields are naturally related to the quantum states of the original field. We demonstrate this conclusion via several examples such as the flat, black hole, and the de Sitter spacetime.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmic expansion and structure formation in running vacuum cosmologies	10.1142/S0217732315400313	We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy varies with redshift. A particularly well-motivated model of this type is the so-called quantum field vacuum, in which both kind of terms H-2 and constant appear in the effective dark energy (DE) density affecting the evolution of the main cosmological functions at the background and perturbation levels. Specifically, it turns out that the functional form of the quantum vacuum endows the vacuum energy of a mild dynamical evolution which could be observed nowadays and appears as dynamical DE. Interestingly, the low-energy behavior is very close to the usual Lambda cold dark matter (ACDM) model, but it is by no means identical. Finally, within the framework of the quantum field vacuum we generalize the large scale structure properties, namely growth of matter perturbations, cluster number counts and spherical collapse model.

Interacting new agegraphic version of pilgrim dark energy	10.1142/S0218271815500613	We discuss the cosmological evolution of the interacting pilgrim dark energy (DE) with conformal age of the universe in flat FRW universe. We evaluate the equation of state (EoS) parameter for three different values of interacting parameter which evolutes the universe from matter dominated to phantom-like eras by evolving quintessence as well as vacuum DE eras. We also give the correspondence of the present DE model with quintessence, tachyon, k-essence, dilaton and DBI-essence scalar field models. We discuss the dynamics of scalar field and corresponding potentials. We find that the behavior of scalar field, corresponding potentials and kinetic energy terms (in k-essence and dilaton field) consistent with the present day observations. Also, cosmological planes such as omega(nu) - omega(nu)' and r - s planes corresponds to Lambda CDM limit.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Creation of particles in a cyclic universe driven by loop quantum cosmology	10.1142/S0218271815500625	We consider an isotropic and homogeneous universe in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). We assume that the matter content of the universe is dominated by dust matter in early time and a phantom matter at late time which constitutes the dark energy component. The quantum gravity modifications to the Friedmann equation in this model indicate that the classical big bang singularity and the future big rip singularity are resolved and are replaced by quantum bounce. It turns out that the big bounce and recollapse in the herein model contribute to a cyclic scenario for the universe. We then study the quantum theory of a massive, nonminimally coupled scalar field undergoing cosmological evolution from primordial bounce towards the late time bounce. In particular, we solve the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field in the primordial and late time regions, in order to investigate particle production phenomena at late time. By computing the energy density of created particles at late time, we show that this density is negligible in comparison to the quantum background density at Planck era. This indicates that the effects of quantum particle production do not influence the future bounce.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Interaction in the dark sector	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.123539	It may well happen that the two main components of the dark sector of the Universe, dark matter and dark energy, do not evolve separately but interact nongravitationally with one another. However, given our current lack of knowledge of the microscopic nature of these two components, there is no clear theoretical path to determine their interaction. Yet, over the years, phenomenological interaction terms have been proposed on mathematical simplicity and heuristic arguments. In this paper, based on the likely evolution of the ratio between the energy densities of these dark components, we lay down reasonable criteria to obtain phenomenological, useful, expressions of the said term independent of any gravity theory. We illustrate this with different proposals which seem compatible with the known evolution of the Universe at the background level. Likewise, we show that two possible degeneracies with noninteracting models are only apparent as they can be readily broken at the background level. Further, we analyze some interaction terms that appear in the literature.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy from quantum mechanics	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.123538	We construct the cosmological model to explain the cosmological constant problem. We built the extension of the standard cosmological model Lambda CDM by consideration of decaying vacuum energy represented by the running cosmological term. From the principles of quantum mechanics one can find that in the long-term behavior survival probability of unstable states is a decreasing function of the cosmological time and has the inverse powerlike form. This implies that cosmological constant rho(vac) = Lambda(t) = Lambda(bare) + alpha/t(2) where Lambda(bare) and alpha are constants. We investigate the dynamics of this model using dynamical system methods due to a link to the Lambda(H) cosmologies. We have found the exact solution for the scale factor as well as the indicators of its variability like the deceleration parameter and the jerk. From the calculation of the jerk we obtain a simple test of the decaying vacuum in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe. Using astronomical data [SNIa, H(z), CMB, BAO] we have estimated the model parameters and compared this model with the Lambda CDM model. Our statistical results indicate that the decaying vacuum model is a little worse than the Lambda CDM model. But the decaying vacuum cosmological model explains the small value of the cosmological constant today.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Reconstructing the interaction between dark energy and dark matter using Gaussian processes	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.123533	We present a nonparametric approach to reconstruct the interaction between dark energy and dark matter directly from SNIa Union 2.1 data using Gaussian processes, which is a fully Bayesian approach for smoothing data. In this method, once the equation of state (w) of dark energy is specified, the interaction can be reconstructed as a function of redshift. For the decaying vacuum energy case with w = -1, the reconstructed interaction is consistent with the standard Lambda CDM model, namely, there is no evidence for the interaction. This also holds for the constant w cases from -0.9 to -1.1 and for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization case. If the equation of state deviates obviously from -1, the reconstructed interaction exists at 95\% confidence level. This shows the degeneracy between the interaction and the equation of state of dark energy when they get constraints from the observational data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy from quantum uncertainty of distant clock	10.1007/JHEP06(2015)063	The observed cosmic acceleration was attributed to an exotic dark energy in the framework of classical general relativity. The dark energy behaves very similar with vacuum energy in quantum mechanics. However, once the quantum effects are seriously taken into account, it predicts a completely wrong result and leads to a severe fine-tuning. To solve the problem, the exact meaning of time in quantum mechanics is reexamined. We abandon the standard interpretation of time in quantum mechanics that time is just a global parameter, replace it by a quantum dynamical variable playing the role of physical clock. We find that synchronization of two spatially separated clocks can not be precisely realized at quantum level. There is an intrinsic quantum uncertainty of distant clock time, which implies an apparent vacuum energy fluctuation and gives an observed dark energy density rho(de) = 6/pi L-P(-2) L-H(-2) at tree level approximation, where L-P and L-H are the Planck and Hubble scale cutoffs. The fraction of the dark energy is given by Omega(de) = 2/pi, which does not evolve with the internal clock time. The ``dark energy{''} as a quantum cosmic variance is always seen comparable with the matter energy density by an observer using the internal clock time. The corrected distance-redshift relation of cosmic observations due to the distant clock effect are also discussed, which again gives a redshift independent fraction Omega(de) = 2/pi. The theory is consistent with current cosmic observations.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Ghosts in the self-accelerating DGP branch with Gauss-Bonnet effect	10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3463-0	The Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati brane-world model provides a possible approach to address the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, it has subsequently been pointed out that a ghost instability will arise on the self-accelerating branch. Here, we carefully investigate whether this ghost problem could be possibly cured by introducing the Gauss-Bonnet term in the five-dimensional bulk action, a natural generalization to the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. Our analysis is carried out for a background where a de Sitter brane is embedded in an anti-de Sitter bulk. Our result shows that the ghost excitations cannot be avoided even in this modified model.

Inflation and dark energy from the Brans-Dicke theory	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/06/031	We consider the Brans-Dicke theory motivated by the f(R) = R + alpha R-n - beta R2-n model to obtain a stable minimum of the Einstein frame scalar potential of the Brans-Dicke field. As a result we have obtained an inflationary scalar potential with non-zero value of residual vacuum energy, which may be a source of dark energy. In addition we discuss the probability of quantum tunnelling from the minimum of the potential. Our results can be easily consistent with PLANCK or BICEP2 data for appropriate choices of the value of n and omega.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Inhomogeneous fluids for warm inflation	10.1007/s10509-015-2397-1	Inhomogeneous fluid models for warm inflation are investigated.

A spherically symmetric null tetrads in non-minimal torsion-matter coupling extension of f(T) gravity	10.1007/s10509-015-2385-5	We construct a null tetrad from a non-diagonal spherically symmetric vierbein field, involving two unknown functions of radial coordinate r. This null tetrad is applied to the equations of motion of non-minimal torsion-matter coupling extension of f(T) gravity. Exact vacuum solution with two constants of integration is obtained. The scalar torsion related to this special solution is constant. The energy of this solution is calculated using the Euclidean continuation method and the known value is derived. We also calculate the thermodynamical quantities of charged Schwarzschild spacetime and investigate the validity of the first law of thermodynamics and quantum statistical relation.

Dark energy in flows of galaxies	10.1134/S1063772915060104	It has traditionally been taken for granted that Hubble's law is the key relation in cosmology, while it is surprisingly mysterious on the local scales of 1-30 Mpc where it was originally discovered. The progress in observational cosmology and, in particular, the discovery of dark energy have changed the views, and now we see that Hubble's law works hardly at truly cosmological distances, but it rules very well on local scales. Recent observations with the HST, in combination with a theory model of the local expansion flows, give a clear evidence to the presence of dark energy in the local universe. It is dark energy that dominates the dynamics of the local flows and introduces to them the approximately linear velocity-distance relation with nearly universal expansion time-rate.

Dark energy in the two-body problem: The local group of galaxies	10.1134/S1063772915050029	The two-body problem of classical mechanics can be extended in a natural way by introducing a universal dark-energy background, which acts as a third dynamical factor. For real systems of galaxies, the corresponding additional acceleration is described by general relativity in the Newtonian limit, in which deviations from the Minkowski metric are very small. It is shown that this acceleration has the same form in different inertial and non-inertial reference frames. The invariance of the acceleration produced by dark energy reflects the fact that, according to its mechanical properties, dark energy is a vacuum that is comoving with any motion. In this generalized formulation, as in the classical case, the two-body problem with a dark-energy background reduces to the motion of a single body in a central field. Two problems of this kind are considered for the Local Group of galaxies. The first, ``internal,{''} problem concerns the binary system formed by the main bodies of the Local Group: our galaxy and M31. The subject of the second, ``external,{''} problem is the binary system formed by the Local Group as a whole and its closest neighbor, the Virgo Cluster. In the internal problem, the effect of the dark energy is that the binary system is not bound if its mass does not exceed 3 x 10(12) M-aS (TM), which is allowed by the observational data. The external problem demonstrates the possibility of an evolutionary scenario in which a group could initially be located in the volume of a cluster, but then leave it and, moving away with an acceleration created by dark energy, arrive at the observed distance from the cluster.

Inflection point inflation and dark energy in supergravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.123502	We consider an inflection point inflationary model in supergravity with a single chiral superfield and show that the predicted values of the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are consistent with the Planck 2015 results. In this model supersymmetry is strongly broken after inflation, which results in a non-supersymmetry de Sitter vacuum responsible for the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe.

Reconstruction of inflation models	10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3443-4	In this paper, we reconstruct viable inflationary models by starting from spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio from Planck observations. We analyze three different kinds of models: scalar field theories, fluid cosmology, and f (R)-modified gravity. We recover the well-known R-2 inflation in Jordan-frame and Einstein-frame representation, the massive scalar inflaton models and two models of inhomogeneous fluid. A model of R-2 correction to Einstein's gravity plus a ``cosmological constant{''} with an exact solution for early-time acceleration is reconstructed.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Dark energy domination in the local flow of giant galaxies	10.1093/mnras/stv144	A dozen of the most luminous galaxies, at distances of up to 10 Mpc from the Local Group, move away from the group, forming the local expansion flow of giants. We use recent Hubble Space Telescope data on local giants and their numerous fainter companions to study the dynamical structure and evolutionary trends of the flow. An N-body computer model, which reproduces the observed kinematics of the flow, is constructed under the assumption that the flow is embedded in the universal dark energy background. In the model, the motions of the flow members are controlled by their mutual attraction force and the repulsion force produced by the dark energy. It is found that the dark energy repulsion dominates the force field of the flow. Because of this, the flow expands with acceleration. The dark energy domination is enhanced by the environment effect of the low mean matter density on the spatial scale of 50 Mpc in the local Universe. The dark energy domination increases with time and introduces to the flow an asymptotically linear velocity-distance relation with the universal time-rate that depends on the dark energy density only.

Self tuning scalar fields in spherically symmetric spacetimes	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/05/009	We search for self tuning solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations for the simplest class of `Fab-Four' models with constant potentials. We first review the conditions under which self tuning occurs in a cosmological spacetime, and by introducing a small modification to the original theory introducing the second and third Galileon terms show how one can obtain de Sitter states where the expansion rate is independent of the vacuum energy. We then consider whether the same self tuning mechanism can persist in a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous spacetime. We show that there are no asymptotically flat solutions to the field equations in which the vacuum energy is screened, other than the trivial one (Minkowski space). We then consider the possibility of constructing Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes for the modified Fab Four plus Galileon theory. We argue that the only model that can successfully screen the vacuum energy in both an FLIRW and Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetime is one containing `John' similar to G(nu)(mu)partial derivative(mu)phi partial derivative(nu)phi and a canonical kinetic term similar to partial derivative(alpha)phi partial derivative(alpha)phi. This behaviour was first observed in [1]. The screening mechanism, which requires redundancy of the scalar field equation in the `vacuum', fails for the `Paul' term in an inhomogeneous spacetime.

Is scalar-tensor gravity consistent with polytropic stellar models?	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/05/001	We study the scalar field potential V(phi) in the scalar-tensor gravity with selfconsistent polytropic stellar configurations. Without choosing a particular potential, we numerically derive the potential inside various stellar objects. We restrict the potential to conform to general relativity or to f(R) gravity inside and require the solution to arrive at SdS vacuum at the surface. The studied objects are required to obtain observationally valid masses and radii corresponding to solar type stars, white dwarfs and neutron stars. We find that the resulting scalar-tensor potential V(phi) for the numerically derived polytrope that conforms to general relativity, in each object class, is highly dependent on the matter configuration as well as on the vacuum requirement at the boundary. As a result, every stellar configuration arrives at a potential V(phi) that is not consistent with the other stellar class potentials. Therefore, a general potential that conforms to all these polytropic stellar classes could not be found.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS

Furthermore, we investigate particular models with a cosmic evolution independent of the material content and use them to understand the general characteristics of this framework. We also consider more realistic models, which we denote the ``term-by-term{''} and ``tripod{''} models, focusing attention on cases in which the critical point is indeed an attractor solution and the cosmological history is of particular interest.

Bianchi type-I transit cosmological models with time dependent gravitational and cosmological constants: reexamined	10.1007/s12648-014-0612-5	The Einstein's field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological ``constants{''} for a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time are obtained in present study. To study the transit behaviour of Universe, we consider a law of variation of scale factor a(t) = (t(k)e(t))(1/n), which yields a time dependent deceleration parameter q = -1 + nk/(k+t)(2), comprising a class of models that depicts a transition of the universe from the early decelerated phase to the recent accelerating phase. We find that the time dependent deceleration parameter is reasonable for the present day Universe and gives an appropriate description of the evolution of the universe. For n = 0.27k, we obtain q(0) = -0.73, which is similar to observed value of deceleration parameter at present epoch. It is also observed that for n >= 2 and k = 1, we obtain a class of transit models of the universe from early decelerating to present accelerating phase. For k = 0, the universe has non-singular origin. In these models, we arrive at the decision that, from the structure of the field equations, the behaviour of cosmological and gravitational constants and are related. Taking into consideration the observational data, we conclude that the cosmological constant behaves as a positive decreasing function of time, whereas gravitational constant is increasing and tends to a constant value at late time. H(z)/(1 + z) data (32 points) and model prediction as a function of redshift for different k and n are successfully presented by using recent data. Some physical and geometric properties of the models are also discussed.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Accelerating dark energy models of the universe in anisotropic Bianchi type space-times and recent observations	10.1134/S1063779615030028	Motivated by the increasing evidence for the need of a geometry that resembles Bianchi morphology to explain the observed anisotropy in the WMAP data, we have discussed some features of the Bianchi type universes in the presence of a fluid that wields an anisotropic equation of state (EoS) parameter in general relativity. Such models are of great interest in cosmology in favor of constructing more realistic models than FLRW models with maximally symmetric spatial geometry. Additionally, the interest in such models was promoted in recent years due to the debate that going on the analysis and the interpretation of the WMAP [21, 111, 112] data, whether they need a Bianchi type morphology to be explained successfully [7, 103, 118, 117]. The LLC-WMAP data maps show seven axes well aligned with one another and the direction Virgo. For this reason Bianchi models are important in the study of anisotropies. In the present study of Bianchi type-I, II, III, V and VI (0) space-times, we observe that the EoS for dark energy omega is found to be time-dependent and its existing range for derived models is in good agreement with the recent observations of SNe Ia data [50], SNe Ia data with CMBR anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics [11] and latest combination of cosmological datasets coming from CMB anisotropies, luminosity distances of high redshift type Ia supernovae and galaxy clustering [21, 51]. It has been suggested that the dark energy that explains the observed accelerating expansion of the universe may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the EoS in a time dependent background. The cosmological constant I > is found to be a positive decreasing function of time and it approaches to a small positive value at late time (i.e. the present epoch) which is corroborated by results from recent type Ia supernovae observations.

Trace-anomaly driven inflation in f(T) gravity with a cosmological constant	10.1007/s10509-015-2269-8	In this paper, we have investigated trace-anomaly (TA) driven inflation in Generalized Teleparallel gravity (namely f(T)). A quasi de Sitter (dS) scenario for inflation is proposed like in the case of R-2 gravity. It has been found that in f (T) gravity, the dS solution for inflation is unstable due to the conformal anomaly (CA). As an illustrative example, we have analyzed trace anomaly driven inflation in a T-2 + f(T)-model. Furthermore, a model with a non zero cosmological constant is studied. We have shown that dS solution always remains unstable also in the presence of cosmological constant, but for Anti dS (AdS) case the situation dramatically changes.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Interacting modified QCD ghost scalar field models of dark energy	10.1007/s10509-015-2299-2	The interacting framework of modified QCD ghost dark energy with cold dark matter is being considered for illustrating the accelerated expansion of the universe. We develop the Hubble parameter numerically and find that it shows increasing behavior which is consistent with the present observations. Also, the equation state parameter shows evolution of the universe from matter dominated universe towards phantom era by evolving the quintessence as well as vacuum eras of the universe. The dynamics of scalar field and corresponding potential of various scalar field models shows consistence behavior with the accelerated expansion phenomenon. Also, the kinetic energy term of k-essence and dilaton models lies within the range where equation of state parameter represents the accelerated expansion of the universe.

Bianchi Type V Cosmological Models with Varying Cosmological Term	10.1007/s10773-014-2340-1	We have analyzed a new class of spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-V cosmological models with perfect fluid distribution in presence of time varying cosmological and gravitational constants in the framework of general relativity. Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are obtained for two types of cosmologies viz. m not equal 3 and m = 3 respectively. We propose an alternate variation law in which the anisotropy (sigma/oee integral) per unit expansion scalar (oee integral) is proportional to a function of scale factor R i.e. (where sigma is a shear scalar) Tiwari (The African Review of Physics, 8, 437-447 2013). Physical properties of the models are discussed in detail. The models isotropize at late times. Some cosmological distance parameters for both the models have also been presented. We also discussed state finder parameters and observe that our solutions favor I > C D M model.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS

Equivalent off-diagonal cosmological models and ekpyrotic scenarios in f (R)-modified, massive, and einstein gravity	10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3407-8	We reinvestigate how generic off-diagonal cosmological solutions depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates can be constructed in massive and f modified gravity using the anholonomic frame deformation method. New classes of locally anisotropic and (in-) homogeneous cosmological metrics are constructed with open and closed spatial geometries. By resorting to such solutions, we show that they describe the late time acceleration due to effective cosmological terms induced by nonlinear off-diagonal interactions, possible modifications of the gravitational action and graviton mass. The cosmological metrics and related Stuckelberg fields are constructed in explicit form up to nonholonomic frame transforms of the Friedmann-Lamaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) coordinates. The solutions include matter, graviton mass, and other effective sources modeling nonlinear gravitational and matter field interactions with polarization of physical constants and deformations of metrics, which may explain dark energy and dark matter effects. However, we argue that it is not always necessary to modify gravity if we consider the effective generalized Einstein equations with nontrivial vacuum and/or non-minimal coupling with matter. Indeed, we state certain conditions when such configurations mimic interesting solutions in general relativity and modifications, for instance, when we can extract the general Painleve-Gullstrand and FLRW metrics. In a more general context, we elaborate on a reconstruction procedure for off-diagonal cosmological solutions which describe cyclic and ekpyrotic universes. Finally, open issues and further perspectives are discussed.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Superconducting dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.085042	Based on the analogy with superconductor physics we consider a scalar-vector-tensor gravitational model, in which the dark energy action is described by a gauge invariant electromagnetic type functional. By assuming that the ground state of the dark energy is in a form of a condensate with the U(1) symmetry spontaneously broken, the gauge invariant electromagnetic dark energy can be described in terms of the combination of a vector and of a scalar field (corresponding to the Goldstone boson), respectively. The gravitational field equations are obtained by also assuming the possibility of a nonminimal coupling between the cosmological mass current and the superconducting dark energy. The cosmological implications of the dark energy model are investigated for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker homogeneous and isotropic geometry for two particular choices of the electromagnetic type potential, corresponding to a pure electric type field, and to a pure magnetic field, respectively. The time evolutions of the scale factor, matter energy density and deceleration parameter are obtained for both cases, and it is shown that in the presence of the superconducting dark energy the Universe ends its evolution in an exponentially accelerating vacuum de Sitter state. By using the formalism of the irreversible thermodynamic processes for open systems we interpret the generalized conservation equations in the superconducting dark energy model as describing matter creation. The particle production rates, the creation pressure and the entropy evolution are explicitly obtained.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy dependent test of general relativity at cosmological scales	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.083536	The Lambda CDM framework offers a remarkably good description of our Universe with a very small number of free parameters, which can be determined with high accuracy from currently available data. However, this does not mean that the associated physical quantities, such as the curvature of the Universe, have been directly measured. Similarly, general relativity is assumed, but not tested. Testing the relevance of general relativity for cosmology at the background level includes a verification of the relation between its energy contents and the curvature of space. Using an extended Newtonian formulation, we propose an approach where this relation can be tested. Using the recent measurements on cosmic microwave background, baryonic acoustic oscillations and the supernova Hubble diagram, we show that the prediction of general relativity is well verified in the framework of standard Lambda CDM assumptions, i.e. an energy content only composed of matter and dark energy, in the form of a cosmological constant or equivalently a vacuum contribution. However, the actual equation of state of dark fluids cannot be directly obtained from cosmological observations. We find that relaxing the equation of state of dark energy opens a large region of possibilities, revealing a new type of degeneracy between the curvature and the total energy content of the Universe.

Vacuum models with a linear and a quadratic term in H: structure formation and number counts analysis	10.1093/mnras/stv209	We focus on the class of cosmological models with a time-evolving vacuum energy density of the form rho Lambda (H) = C-0 + C1H + C2H2, where H is the Hubble rate. Higher powers of H could be important for the early inflationary epoch, but are irrelevant afterwards. We study these models at the background level and at the perturbations level, both at the linear and at the non-linear regime. We find that those with C-0 = 0 are seriously hampered, as they are unable to fit simultaneously the current observational data on Hubble expansion and the linear growth rate of clustering. This is in contrast to the C-0 not equal 0 models, including the concordance Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM) model. We also compute the redshift distribution of clusters predicted by all these models, in which the analysis of the non-linear perturbations becomes crucial. The outcome is that the models with C-0 = 0 predict a number of counts with respect to the concordance model which is much larger, or much smaller, than the Lambda CDM and the dynamical models with C-0 not equal 0. The particular case rho Lambda (H) alpha H (the pure lineal model), which in the past was repeatedly motivated by several authors from QCD arguments applied to cosmology, is also addressed and we assess in detail its phenomenological status. We conclude that the most favoured models are those with C-0 not equal 0, and we show how to discriminate them from the Lambda CDM.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY

Constraints on the dark matter sound speed from galactic scales: The cases of the modified and extended Chaplygin gas	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.083508	We show that the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies constrain the sound speed of the dark matter to be c(s) < 10(-4)c, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Using the modified Chaplygin gas as a representative example of a class of unified dark energy models incorporating an effective dark matter component with a nonzero sound speed, we determine the most stringent constraint to date on the value of the constant contribution to the equation of state parameter in this class of models. Finally, we explain the reason why previous constraints using the cosmic microwave background and baryonic acoustic oscillations were not as competitive as the one presented in this paper and discuss the limitations of the recently proposed extended Chaplygin gas.

Inflation and CMB Anisotropy from Quantum Metric Fluctuations	10.1134/S0202289315020061	We propose a model of cosmological evolution of the early and late Universe which is consistent with observational data and naturally explains the origin of inflation and dark energy. We show that the de Sitter accelerated expansion of the FLRW space with no matter fields (hereinafter, empty space) is its natural state, and the model does not require either a scalar field or cosmological constant or any other hypotheses. This is due to the fact that the De Sitter State is an exact solution of the rigorous mathematically consistent equations of one-loop quantum gravity for the empty FLRW space that are finite off the mass shell. Space without matter fields is not empty as it always has the natural quantum fluctuations of the metric, i.e. gravitons. Therefore, the empty (in this sense) space is filled with gravitons, which have the backreaction effect on its evolution over time forming a self-consistent de Sitter instanton leading to the exponentially accelerated expansion of the Universe. At the start and the end of cosmological evolution, the Universe is assumed to be empty, and this fact explains the origin of inflation and dark energy. The Universe starts and ends with de Sitter expansion but the evolutionary process runs in these cases in opposite directions. It leads to the prediction that the signs of the parameter 1 + w should be opposite in the two cases, which is consistent with observations. Fluctuations of the number of gravitons lead to fluctuations of their energy density which in turn leads to the observed CMB temperature anisotropy of the order of similar to 10(-5) and CMB polarization. Within this scenario, it is not a hypothetical scalar field that generates inflation and relic gravitational waves but on the contrary, gravitational waves (gravitons) generate inflation, CMB anisotropy and dark energy.

Could the dynamics of the Universe be influenced by what is going on inside black holes?	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/04/024	We investigate the potential impact of mass inflation inside black holes on the dynamics of the Universe, considering a recent reformulation of general relativity, proposed in [10], which prevents the vacuum energy from acting as a gravitational source. The interior dynamics of accreting black holes is studied, at the classical level, using the homogeneous approximation and taking charge as a surrogate for angular momentum. We show that, depending on the accreting fluid properties, mass inflation inside black holes could influence the value of the cosmological constant and thus the dynamics of the Universe. A full assessment of the cosmological role played by black holes will require a deeper understanding of the extremely energetic regimes expected inside real astrophysical black holes, including their relation with the physics of the very early Universe, and may eventually lead to an entirely new paradigm for the origin and evolution of the Universe.

Decaying vacuum inflationary cosmologies: Searching for a complete scenario including curvature effects	10.1142/S0218271815410060	We propose a large class of nonsingular cosmologies of arbitrary spatial curvature whose cosmic history is determined by a primeval dynamical Lambda(t)-term. For all values of the curvature, the models evolve between two extreme de Sitter phases driven by the relic time-varying vacuum energy density. The transition from inflation to the radiation phase is universal and points to a natural solution of the graceful exit problem regardless of the values of the curvature parameter. The flat case recovers the scenario recently discussed in the literature [Perico et al., Phys. Rev. D 88 (2013) 063531]. The early de Sitter phase is characterized by an arbitrary energy scale H-I associated to the primeval vacuum energy density. If H-I is fixed to be nearly the Planck scale, the ratio between the relic and the present observed vacuum energy density is rho vI/rho v0 similar or equal to 10(118).

The (Lambda)over-barCDM cosmology: From inflation to dark energy through running Lambda	10.1142/S0218271815410035	Perhaps the deepest mystery of our accelerating universe in expansion is the existence of a tiny and rigid cosmological constant, Lambda. Its size is many orders of magnitude below the expected one in the standard model of particle physics. This is a very welcome fact, namely if we care at all about our own existence and fate. However, we do not have a minimally satisfactory explanation for our good fortune and for the failing of the SM at that crucial point. To start with, an expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density. We should rather observe a mildly dynamical behavior delta Lambda(t) similar to R similar to H-2(t) with the expansion rate H. At the same time, it is natural to think that the huge value of the primeval vacuum energy (presumably connected to some GUT) was responsible for the initial inflationary phase. In the traditional inflaton models such phase is inserted by hand in the early epoch of the cosmic evolution, and it is assumed to match the standard Lambda CDM regime during the radiation epoch. Here, instead, we consider a class of dynamical vacuum models which incorporate in a single vacuum structure (Lambda) over bar (H) the rapid stage of inflation, followed by the radiation and cold matter epochs, until achieving our dark energy universe. The early behavior of such ``running vacuum model{''} ((Lambda) over bar CDM) bares resemblance with Starobinsky's inflation in the early universe and is very close to the concordance model for the entire post-inflationary history. Most remarkably, the inflationary period in the (Lambda) over bar CDM terminates with ``graceful exit{''} and the large entropy problem can be solved. The model is compatible with the latest cosmological data on Hubble expansion and structure formation, and at the same time presents distinctive observational features that can be tested in the near future.

Ghost quintessence in fractal gravity	10.1007/s12043-014-0850-2	In this study, using the time-like fractal theory of gravity, we mainly focus on the ghost dark energy model which was recently suggested to explain the present acceleration of the cosmic expansion. Next, we establish a connection between the quintessence scalar field and fractal ghost dark energy density. This correspondence allows us to reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of a fractal canonical scalar field (the fractal quintessence) according to the evolution of ghost dark energy density.

Nonsingular decaying vacuum cosmology and entropy production	10.1007/s10714-015-1888-2	The thermodynamic behavior of a decaying vacuum cosmology describing the entire cosmological history evolving between two extreme (early and late time) de Sitter eras is investigated. The thermal evolution from the early de Sitter to the radiation phase is discussed in detail. The temperature evolution law and the increasing entropy function are analytically determined. The entropy of the effectively massless particles is initially zero but evolves continuously to the present day maximum value within the current Hubble radius, S-0 similar to 10(88) in natural units. By using the Gibbons-Hawking temperature relation for the de Sitter spacetime, it is found that the ratio between the primeval and the late time vacuum energy densities rho(vI)/rho(v0) similar to 10(123), as required by some naive estimates from quantum field theory.

Unification of inflation and dark energy a la quintessential inflation	10.1142/S0218271815300141	This pedagogical review is devoted to quintessential inflation, which refers to unification of inflation and dark energy using a single scalar field. We present a brief but concise description of the concepts needed to join the two ends, which include discussion on scalar field dynamic, conformal coupling, instant preheating and relic gravitational waves. Models of quintessential inflation broadly fall into two classes, depending upon the early and late time behavior of the field potential. In the first type we include models in which the field potential is steep for most of the history of the universe but turn shallow at late times, whereas in the second type the potential is shallow at early times followed by a steep behavior thereafter. In models of the first category inflation can be realized by invoking high-energy brane-induced damping, which is needed to facilitate slow roll along a steep potential. In models of second type one may invoke a nonminimal coupling of the scalar field with massive neutrino matter, which might induce a minimum in the potential at late times as neutrinos turn nonrelativistic. In this category we review a class of models with noncanonical kinetic term in the Lagrangian, which can comply with recent B mode polarization measurements. The scenario under consideration is distinguished by the presence of a kinetic phase, which precedes the radiative regime, giving rise to blue spectrum of gravity waves generated during inflation. We highlight the generic features of quintessential inflation and also discuss on issues related to Lyth bound.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Inflation, de Sitter landscape and super-Higgs effect	10.1007/JHEP03(2015)111	We continue developing cosmological models involving nilpotent chiral super-fields, which provide a simple unified description of inflation and the current acceleration of the universe in the supergravity context. We describe here a general class of models with a positive cosmological constant at the minimum of the potential, such that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in the direction of the nilpotent superfield S. In the unitary gauge, these models have a simple action where all highly non-linear fermionic terms of the classical Volkov-Akulov action disappear. We present masses for bosons and fermions in these theories. By a proper choice of parameters in this class of models, one can fit any possible set of the inflationary parameters Its and r, a broad range of values of the vacuum energy V-0 plays the role of the dark energy, and achieve a controllable level of supersymmetry breaking. This can be done without introducing light moduli, such as Polonyi fields, which often lead to cosmological problems in phenomenological supergravity.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Phantom behavior via cosmological creation of particles	10.1103/PhysRevD.91.063526	Recent determinations of the equation of state of dark energy hint that this may well be of the phantom type, i.e., w(de) < -1. If confirmed by future experiments, this would strongly point to the existence of fields that violate the dominant energy condition, which are known to present serious theoretical difficulties. This paper presents an alternative to this possibility, namely, that the measured equation of state, wde, is in reality an effective one, the equation of state of the quantum vacuum, w(Lambda) = -1, plus the negative equation of state, w(c), associated to the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the vacuum. To illustrate this, three phenomenological models are proposed and constrained with recent observational data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Number counts and dynamical vacuum cosmologies	10.1093/mnras/stu2662	We study non-linear structure formation in an interacting model of the dark sector of the Universe in which the dark energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, rho(Lambda) alpha H, leading to a constant-rate creation of cold dark matter. We derive all relevant expressions to calculate the mass function and the cluster number density using the Sheth-Torman formalism and show that the effect of the interaction process is to increase the number of bound structures of large masses (M greater than or similar to 10(14) M(circle dot)h(-1)) when compared to the standard Lambda cold dark matter model. Since these models are not reducible to each other, this number counts signature can in principle be tested in future surveys.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Accretion and evaporation of modified Hayward black hole	10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3349-1	We assume the most general static spherically symmetric black hole metric. The accretion of any general kind of fluid flow around the black hole is investigated. The accretion of the fluid flow around the modified Hayward black hole is analyzed, and we then calculate the critical point, the fluid's four-velocity, and the velocity of sound during the accretion process. Also the nature of the dynamical mass of the black hole during accretion of the fluid flow, taking into consideration Hawking radiation from the black hole, i.e., evaporation of the black hole, is analyzed.

QED vacuum loops and inflation	10.1140/epjc/s10052-015-3346-4	A QED-based model of a new version of vacuum energy has recently been suggested, which leads to a simple, finite, one parameter representation of dark energy. An elementary, obvious, but perhaps radical generalization is then able to describe both dark energy and inflation in the same framework of vacuum energy. One further, obvious generalization then leads to a relation between inflation and the big bang, to the automatic inclusion of dark matter, and to a possible understanding of the birth (and death) of a universe.

Cosmological tests of coupled Galileons	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/03/028	We investigate the cosmological properties of Galileon models which admit Minkowski space as a stable solution in vacuum. This is motivated by stable, positive tension brane world constructions that give rise to Galileons. We include both conformal and disformal couplings to matter and focus on constraints on the theory that arise because of these couplings. The disformal coupling to baryonic matter is extremely constrained by astrophysical and particle physics effects. The disformal coupling to photons induces a cosmological variation of the speed of light and therefore distorsions of the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum which are known to be very small. The conformal coupling to baryons leads to a variation of particle masses since Big Bang Nucleosynthesis which is also tightly constrained. We consider the background cosmology of Galileon models coupled to Cold Dark Matter (CDM), photons and baryons and impose that the speed of light and particle masses respect the observational bounds on cosmological time scales. We find that requiring that the equation of state for the Galileon models must be close to -1 now restricts severely their parameter space and can only be achieved with a combination of the conformal and disformal couplings. This leads to large variations of particle masses and the speed of light which are not compatible with observations. As a result, we find that cosmological Galileon models are viable dark energy theories coupled to dark matter but their couplings, both disformal and conformal, to baryons and photons must be heavily suppressed making them only sensitive to CDM.

Probing dark energy with atom interferometry	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/03/042	Theories of dark energy require a screening mechanism to explain why the associated scalar fields do not mediate observable long range fifth forces. The archetype of this is the chameleon field. Here we show that individual atoms are too small to screen the chameleon field inside a large high-vacuum chamber, and therefore can detect the field with high sensitivity. We derive new limits on the chameleon parameters from existing experiments, and show that most of the remaining chameleon parameter space is readily accessible using atom interferometry.

Inflation and dark energy with a single superfield	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/03/017	We discuss the possibility to construct supergravity models with a single super field describing inflation as well as the tiny cosmological constant V similar to 10(-120). One could expect that the simplest way to do it is to study models with a supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum and then slightly uplift them. However, due to the recently proven no-go theorem, such a tiny uplifting cannot be achieved by a small modification of the parameters of the theory. We illustrate this general result by investigation of models with a single chiral super field recently proposed by Ketov and Terada. We show that the addition of a small constant or a linear term to the superpotential of a model with a stable supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum converts it to an AdS vacuum, which results in a rapid cosmological collapse. One can avoid this problem and uplift a supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum to a dS vacuum with V-0 similar to 10(-120) without violating the no-go theorem by making these extra terms large enough. However, we show that this leads to a strong supersymmetry breaking in the uplifted vacua.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
DARK MATTER, DARK ENERGY AND THE FUTURE OF PARTICLE PHYSICS	10.5506/APhysPolB.46.729	The existence of dark matter and dark energy would be evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and an essential ingredient to a Standard Model of cosmology. The main avenues to making progress in these topics are the search for Super-symmetry, the search for axions and the probing of the quantum vacuum. The crucial tools needed for this research program are future particle accelerators which are affordable and ultra high intensity lasers.

Gravity as a quantum entanglement force	10.3938/jkps.66.1025	We conjecture that total the quantum entanglement of matter and vacuum in the universe tends to increase with time, like entropy, and that an effective force is associated with this tendency. We also suggest that gravity and dark energy are types of quantum entanglement forces, similar to Verlinde's entropic force, and give holographic dark energy with an equation of state comparable to current observational data. This connection between quantum entanglement and gravity could give some new insights into the origins of gravity, dark energy, and the arrow of time.	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY

CONSTRAINING COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS WITH IMAGE SEPARATION STATISTICS OF GRAVITATIONALLY LENSED SDSS QUASARS: MEAN IMAGE SEPARATION AND LIKELIHOOD INCORPORATING LENS GALAXY BRIGHTNESS	10.5303/JKAS.2015.48.1.83	Recent large scale surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey have produced homogeneous samples of multiple-image gravitationally lensed quasars with well-defined selection effects. Statistical analysis on these can yield independent constraints on cosmological parameters. Here we use the image separation statistics of lensed quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search (SQLS) to derive constraints on cosmological parameters. Our analysis does not require knowledge of the magnification bias, which can only be estimated from the detailed knowledge on the quasar luminosity function at all redshifts, and includes the consideration for the bias against small image separation quasars due to selection against faint lens galaxy in the follow-up observations for confirmation. We first use the mean image separation of the lensed quasars as a function of redshift to find that cosmological models with extreme curvature are inconsistent with observed lensed quasars. We then apply the maximum likelihood test to the statistical sample of 16 lensed quasars that have both measured redshift and magnitude of lens galaxy. The likelihood incorporates the probability that the observed image separation is realized given the luminosity of the lens galaxy in the same manner as Im et al. (1997). We find that the 95\% confidence range for the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density) is 0.72 < Omega(A) <= 1.0 for a flat universe. We also find that the equation of state parameter can be consistent with 1 as long as the matter density Omega(m) less than or similar to 0.4 (95\% confidence range). We conclude that the image separation statistics incorporating the brightness of lens galaxies can provide robust constraints on the cosmological parameters.

Aspects of nonlocality in quantum field theory, quantum gravity and cosmology	10.1142/S0217732315400039	This paper contains a collection of essays on nonlocal phenomena in quantum field theory, gravity and cosmology. Mechanisms of nonlocal contributions to the quantum effective action are discussed within the covariant perturbation expansion in field strengths and spacetime curvatures. Euclidean version of the Schwinger-Keldysh technique for quantum expectation values is presented as a special rule of obtaining the nonlocal effective equations of motion for the mean quantum field from the Euclidean effective action. This rule is applied to a new model of ghost free nonlocal cosmology which can generate the de Sitter (dS) cosmological evolution at an arbitrary value of Lambda - a model of dark energy with the dynamical scale selected by a kind of a scaling symmetry breaking mechanism. This model is shown to interpolate between the superhorizon phase of a scalar mediated gravity and the short distance general relativistic limit in a special metric frame related by a nonlocal conformal transformation to the original metric.

Phase Space Analysis and Anisotropic Universe Model in f (T) Gravity		In this paper, we study the stability of locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi I universe model in f(T) gravity through phase space analysis. We assume that the f(T) gravity can be treated as effective dark energy behaving like perfect fluid, and suggest that there are interactions between pressureless matter as well as dark energy. We construct the corresponding autonomous system of equations to check the stability of the model for non phantom, vacuum and phantom phases. It is concluded that critical points remain more stable in phantom phase as compared to non phantom and vacuum cases. Finally, we discuss the cosmological behavior of the model through some cosmological parameters.	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Spherically symmetric vacuum solutions arising from trace dynamics modifications to gravitation	10.1142/S021827181550011X	We derive the equations governing static, spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations, as modified by the frame-dependent effective action (derived from trace dynamics) that gives an alternative explanation of the origin of ``dark energy{''}. We give analytic and numerical results for the solutions of these equations, first in polar coordinates, and then in isotropic coordinates. General features of the static case are that: (i) there is no horizon, since g00 is nonvanishing for finite values of the polar radius, and only vanishes (in isotropic coordinates) at the internal singularity, (ii) the Ricci scalar R vanishes identically, and (iii) there is a physical singularity at cosmological distances. The large distance singularity may be an artifact of the static restriction, since we find that the behavior at large distances is altered in a time-dependent solution using the McVittie Ansatz.

Observed cosmological reexpansion in minimal QFT with bose and fermi fields	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2014.06.012	In this work we aim at explaining the re-acceleration of the expansion of the universe, or equivalently, the hierarchy problem, with the help of a simple field-theoretical model. In particular, we want to account for the notorious discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological expansion term and theoretical values of the vacuum energy of free quantum fields. Rendered infinite by short-wavelength fluctuations, evaluation up to a cutoff in momentum space at the Planck scale leads to contributions of the order of 10(76) GeV4. The observed value of the cosmic expansion being of the order of 10(-47) GeV4, this is a difference of 123 orders of magnitude. We propose a possible resolution of the hierarchy problem by a cancelation of divergences by equivalent contributions of bosonic and fermionic fields of the system, albeit after some fine-tuning of the parameters of the field theory. We show that in principle nothing beyond conventional ingredients of quantum field theory is necessary to provide us with a possible explanation of the observed dark energy, and thus with a solution to the hierarchy problem.

On recent claims concerning the R-h = ct Universe	10.1093/mnras/stu2181	The R-h = ct universe is a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology which, like Lambda cold dark matter (Lambda CDM), assumes the presence of dark energy in addition to (baryonic and non-luminous) matter and radiation. Unlike Lambda CDM, however, it is also constrained by the equation of state (EOS) p = -rho/3, in terms of the total pressure p and energy density rho. One-on-one comparative tests between R-h = ct and Lambda CDM have been carried out using over 14 different cosmological measurements and observations. In every case, the data have favoured R-h = ct over the standard model, with model selection tools yielding a likelihood similar to 90-95 per cent that the former is correct, versus only similar to 5-10 per cent for the latter. In other words, the standard model without the EOS p = -rho/3 does not appear to be the optimal description of nature. Yet in spite of these successes - or perhaps because of them - several concerns have been published recently regarding the fundamental basis of the theory itself. The latest paper on this subject even claims - quite remarkably - that R-h = ct is a vacuum solution, though quite evidently rho not equal 0. Here, we address these concerns and demonstrate that all criticisms levelled thus far against R-h = ct, including the supposed vacuum condition, are unwarranted. They all appear to be based on incorrect assumptions or basic theoretical errors. Nevertheless, continued scrutiny such as this will be critical to establishing R-h = ct as the correct description of nature.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Gravitational Lensing: Einstein's unfinished symphony	10.1080/00107514.2015.1006001	Gravitational lensing - the deflection of light rays by gravitating matter - has become a major tool in the armoury of the modern cosmologist. Proposed nearly a hundred years ago as a key feature of Einstein's theory of general relativity, we trace the historical development since its verification at a solar eclipse in 1919. Einstein was apparently cautious about its practical utility and the subject lay dormant observationally for nearly 60 years. Nonetheless there has been rapid progress over the past twenty years. The technique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on large and small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological model which assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. By measuring the distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmic time, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether the dark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is a vacuum energy density or a failure of general relativity on large scales. We illustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power of gravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified by massive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten a background star. We summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground and space-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.	CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS
Applications of black hole lattices in relativistic cosmology	10.1063/1.4937219	This talk addresses the question of how to model an inhomogeneous universe, and in particular how to model a universe in which all mass is distributed amongst a family of discrete sources (non-rotating black holes). Inhomogeneous cosmological models can be used to place observations of accelerating expansion within wider theoretical frameworks, and can hence be used to critically evaluate the evidence for the existence of dark energy. We use analytic methods to investigate the solutions to Einstein's equations in vacuum along networks of curves that exhibit local rotational and reflection symmetry. It is shown that the deceleration parameter can be negative without invoking the existence of any exotic fluids. The role of the small-scale inhomogeneities on the large-scale expansion of the Universe is studied in a fully non-perturbative and relativistic way, which is made possible by the discrete symmetries of the model. A comparison with other approaches for modeling dark energy and quantifying the effects of local inhomogeneities is discussed.

Matter in the form of toroidal electromagnetic vortices	10.1117/12.2192141	The creation of charged elementary particles from neutral photons is explained as a conversion process of electromagnetic (EM) energy from linear to circular motion at the speed of light into two localized, toroidal shaped vortices of trapped EM energy that resist change of motion, perceptible as particles with inertia and hence mass. The photon can be represented as a superposition of left and right circular polarized transverse electric fields of opposite polarity originating from a common zero potential axis, the optical axis of the photon. If these components are separated by interaction with a strong field (nucleon) they would curl up into two electromagnetic vortices (EMV) due to longitudinal magnetic field components forming toroids. These vortices are perceptible as opposite charged elementary particles e.. These spinning toroids generate extended oscillating fields that interact with stationary field oscillations. The velocity-dependent frequency differences cause beat signals equivalent to matter waves, leading to interference. The extended fields entangled with every particle explain wave particle duality issues. Spin and magnetic moment are the natural outcome of these gyrating particles. As the energy and hence mass of the electron increases with acceleration so does its size shrink proportional to its reduced wavelength. The artificial weak and strong nuclear forces can be easily explained as different manifestations of the intermediate EM forces. The unstable neutron consists of a proton surrounded by a contracted and captured electron. The associated radial EM forces represent the weak nuclear force. The deuteron consists of two axially separated protons held together by a centrally captured electron. The axial EM forces represent the strong nuclear force, providing stability for ``neutrons{''} only within nucleons. The same principles were applied to determine the geometries of force-balanced nuclei. The alpha-particle emerges as a very compact symmetric cuboid that provides a unique building block to assemble the isotopic chart. Exotic neutron-4 appears viable which may explain dark matter. The recognition that all heavy particles, including the protons, are related to electrons via muons and pions explains the identity of all charges to within 10(-36). Greater deviations would overpower gravitation. Gravitation can be traced to EM vacuum fluctuations generated by standing EM waves between interacting particles. On that basis, gravity can be correlated via microscopic quantities to the age of the universe of 13.5 billion years. All forces and particles and potentially dark matter and dark energy are different manifestations of EM energy.	NATURE OF LIGHT: WHAT ARE PHOTONS? VI
Cosmic Rays Report from the Structure of Space	10.1155/2015/135025	Spectrum of cosmic rays follows a broken power law over twelve orders of magnitude. Since ubiquitous power laws are manifestations of the principle of least action, we interpret the spectrum accordingly. Our analysis complies with understanding that low-energy particles originate mostly from rapidly receding sources throughout the cosmos. The flux peaks about proton rest energy whereafter it decreases because fewer and fewer receding sources are energetic enough to provide particles with high enough velocities to compensate for the recessional velocities. Above 10(15.6) eV the flux from the expanding Universe diminishes below the flux from the nearby nonexpanding part of the Universe. In this spectral feature, known as the ``knee,{''} we relate to a distance of about 1.3 Mpc where the gravitational potential tallies the energy density of free space. At higher energies particles decelerate in a dissipative manner to attain thermodynamic balance with the vacuum. At about 10(17.2) eV a distinct dissipative mechanism opens up for protons to slow down by electron-positron pair production. At about 10(19.6) eV a more effective mechanism opens up via pion production. All in all, the universal principle discloses that the broad spectrum of cosmic rays probes the structure of space from cosmic distances down to microscopic details.	ADVANCES IN ASTRONOMY
Beyond Einstein's General Relativity	10.1088/1742-6596/600/1/012006	Modern astrophysical and cosmological models are plagued with two severe theoretical difficulties, namely, the dark energy and the dark matter problems. Relative to the former, high-precision observational data have confirmed with startling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion. This phase, one of the most important and challenging current problems in cosmology, represents a new imbalance in the governing gravitational equations. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have been proposed in the literature, in particular, dark energy models and modified gravity, amongst others. Outstanding questions are related to the nature of this so-called ``dark energy{''} that is driving the acceleration of the universe, and whether it is due to the vacuum energy or a dynamical field. On the other hand, the late-time cosmic acceleration may be due to modifications of General Relativity, which introduce new degrees of freedom to the gravitational sector itself. We analyze some of the modified theories of gravity that address these intriguing and exciting problems facing modern physics, and explore the foundations of gravitation theory, essential for the construction of modified theories of gravity.

Geometric phase in vacuum condensates, application to Unruh effect and to quantum thermometer	10.1088/1742-6596/626/1/012060	We report on the recent results revealing the presence of the geometric phase in all the systems characterized by particle creation from vacuum and vacuum condensates. This fact makes the geometric phase a useful tool in the study and the understanding of disparate phenomena. Its possible application ranges from the dynamical Casimir effect to the Hawking effect, from quantum field theory in curved space to the study of CP and CPT symmetries, from the graphen physics to superconductivity and to the Bose Einstein condensate. Here, we consider the possibility of the detection of the Unruh effect and of the fabrication of a very precise quantum thermometer. We analyze the Mukunda-Simon phase for a two level atom system and consider two case: 1) atoms accelerated in electromagnetic field, and 2) atoms interacting with thermal states. The Mukunda-Simon phase generalizes the Berry phase to the case of non-cyclic and non-adiabatic evolutions; therefore it represents a more useful instrument in experimental implementations with respect to the Berry phase.

Cosmology with a decaying vacuum energy parametrization derived from quantum mechanics	10.1088/1742-6596/626/1/012033	Within the quantum mechanical treatment of the decay problem one finds that at late times t the survival probability of an unstable state cannot have the form of an exponentially decreasing function of time t but it has an inverse power-like form. This is a general property of unstable states following from basic principles of quantum theory. The consequence of this property is that in the case of false vacuum states the cosmological constant becomes dependent on time: A-Abare equivalent to A(t) A(bare) similar to 1/t(2). We construct the cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy density and matter for solving the cosmological constant problem and the coincidence problem. We show the equivalence of the proposed decaying false vacuum cosmology with the A (t) cosmologies (the A (t)CDM models). The cosmological implications of the model of decaying vacuum energy (dark energy) are discussed. We constrain the parameters of the model with decaying vacuum using astronomical data. For this aim we use the observation of distant supernovae of type Ia, measurements of H (z), BAO, CMB and others. The model analyzed is in good agreement with observation data and explain a small value of the cosmological constant today.	"7TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP DICE2014 SPACETIME - MATTER - QUANTUM

A sensitive search for dark energy through chameleon scalar fields using neutron interferometry	10.1088/1742-6596/578/1/012009	The physical origin of the dark energy, which is postulated to cause the accelerated expansion rate of the universe, is one of the major open questions of cosmology. A large subset of theories postulate the existence of a scalar field with a nonlinear coupling to matter chosen so that the effective range and/or strength of the field is greatly suppressed unless the source is placed in vacuum. We describe a measurement using neutron interferometry which can place a stringent upper bound on chameleon fields proposed as a solution to the problem of the origin of dark energy of the universe in the regime with a strongly-nolinear coupling term. In combination with other experiments searching for exotic short-range forces and laser-based measurements, slow neutron experiments are capable of eliminating this and many similar types of scalar-field-based dark energy models by laboratory experiments.

Charged axially-symmetric solution in f(T) gravity theory	10.1007/s12648-014-0516-4	In present article, an axially symmetric tetrad field has been applied to the charged field equations of f(T) gravity theory. Some constraints have been imposed to solve the resulting non-linear partial differential equations. An exact non-vacuum charged solution with three constants of integration is derived. The solution does not have non-trivial scalar torsion, T = (TjkSijk)-S-i. Total conserved charges, using Poincare gauge version, are calculated to understand the physical meaning of the three constants of integration. It has been shown that these constants are gravitational mass, angular momentum of the rotating source and charge parameter.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
BIANCHI TYPE-I COSMOLOGICAL MODELS WITH TIME DEPENDENT GRAVITATIONAL AND COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANTS: AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH		The present study deals with the exact solutions of the Einstein's field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological ``constants{''} for a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time. We assume that the conservation law for the matter is fulfilled. Hence giving rise to separate equations one for the perfect fluid and other connecting gravitational and cosmological constants. Assuming that G be a function of volume scale V. the metric functions, A-term, energy density and pressure are found to be functions of V. The equation for V is found through Einstein's field equations and solved both analytically and numerically. The present study also allows a time dependent deceleration parameter (DP). It is found that for empty universe, the derived model is accelerating whereas for radiating dominated and stiff fluid universes, we obtain models that depict a transition of the universe from the early decelerated phase to the recent accelerating phase. The cosmological constant A is obtained as a decreasing function of time and approaching a small positive value at present epoch which is corroborated by consequences from recent supernovae Ia observations. The physical significances of the cosmological models have also been discussed.	ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Dynamical vacuum energy in the expanding Universe confronted with observations: a dedicated study	10.1088/1475-7516/2015/01/004	Despite the many efforts, our theoretical understanding of the ultimate nature of the dark energy component of the universe still lags well behind the astounding experimental evidence achieved from the increasingly sophisticated observational tools at our disposal. While the canonical possibility is a strict cosmological constant, or rigid vacuum energy density rho(Lambda) = const., the exceeding simplicity of this possibility lies also at the root of its unconvincing theoretical status, as there is no explanation for the existence of such constant for the entire cosmic history. Herein we explore general models of the vacuum energy density slowly evolving with the Hubble function H and/or its time derivative, rho(Lambda) = rho(Lambda)(H, H). Some of these models are actually well-motivated from the theoretical point of view and may provide a rich phenomenology that could be explored in future observations, whereas some others have more limitations. In this work, we put them to the test and elucidate which ones are still compatible with the present observations and which ones are already ruled out. We consider their implications on structure formation, in combination with data on type Ia supernovae, the Cosmic Microwave Background, the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and the predicted redshift distribution of cluster-size collapsed structures. The relation of these vacuum models on possible evidence of dynamical dark energy recently pointed out in the literature is also briefly addressed.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Entropic cosmology in a dissipative universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.123516	The bulk viscosity of cosmological fluid and the creation of cold dark matter both result in the generation of irreversible entropy (related to dissipative processes) in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. To consider such effects, the general cosmological equations are reformulated, focusing on a spatially flat matter-dominated universe. A phenomenological entropic-force model is examined that includes constant terms as a function of the dissipation rate ranging from (mu) over bar = 0, corresponding to a nondissipative Lambda CDM (lambda cold dark matter) model, to (mu) over bar = 1, corresponding to a fully dissipative CCDM (creation of cold dark matter) model. A time-evolution equation is derived for the matter density contrast in order to characterize density perturbations in the present entropic-force model. It is found that the dissipation rate affects the density perturbations even if the background evolution of the late universe is equivalent to that of a fine-tuned pure Lambda CDM model. With increasing dissipation rate (mu) over bar, the calculated growth rate for the clustering gradually deviates from observations, especially at low redshifts. However, the growth rate for low (mu) over bar (less than 0.1) is found to agree well with measurements. A low-dissipation model predicts a smaller growth rate than does the pure Lambda CDM model (for which (mu) over bar = 0). More detailed data are needed to distinguish the low-dissipation model from the pure Lambda CDM one.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological coincidence without fine tuning	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.123003	We present a simple cosmological model in which a single, nonminimally coupled scalar field with a quartic potential is responsible for both inflation at early times and acceleration at late times. Little or no fine tuning is needed to explain why the present density of dark energy is comparable to that of pressureless matter. Dark energy is identified with the potential of the scalar field, which is sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This becomes significant when matter has decoupled from radiation and become fully nonrelativistic, so that phi proportional to rho(1/3)(m) proportional to rho(1/3)(m,0)(a(0)/a) similar to (10(-120))(1/3)(10(10)) similar to 10(-30) and V similar to phi(4) similar to 10(-120) in Planck units, as observed.

ELKO applications in cosmology	10.1142/S0218271814440088	A brief review is presented about the ELKO spinor field applied to cosmology, with the main results and limitations of the theory. As a simple application, we have analyzed a model involving the interaction of the ELKO spinor field with dark matter in the universe from a dynamical system approach. When the system is rewritten in terms of the deceleration parameter q and under the assumption that such parameter is nearly constant for some different stages of the evolution, stability points were found for different types of interaction between dark matter and ELKO spinors. Within this new analysis several interesting scenarios are possible, depending on the interaction term. For example, if it is assumed that the equation of the state parameter of the ELKO field is of the phantom type omega(phi) < -1, the current acceleration of the universe can be driven by the decay of dark matter particles into ELKO field. Furthermore, even for omega(phi) > 0, the inflationary period can be driven by the decay of the inflaton field (described by the ELKO spinor) into dark matter particles.

Higgs vacuum stability and inflationary dynamics after BICEP2 and PLANCK dust polarisation data	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/12/001	If the recent detection of B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background by BICEP2 observations, withstand the test of time after the release of recent PLANCK dust polarisation data, then it would surprisingly put the inflationary scale near Grand Unification scale if one considers single-field inflationary models. On the other hand, Large Hadron Collider has observed the elusive Higgs particle whose presently observed mass can lead to electroweak vacuum instability at high scale (similar to O(10(10)) GeV). In this article, we seek for a simple particle physics model which can simultaneously keep the vacuum of the theory stable and yield high-scale inflation successfully. To serve our purpose, we extend the Standard Model of particle physics with a U(1)(B-L) gauged symmetry which spontaneously breaks down just above the inflationary scale. Such a scenario provides a constrained parameter space where both the issues of vacuum stability and high-scale inflation can be successfully accommodated. The threshold effect on the Higgs quartic coupling due to the presence of the heavy inflaton field plays an important role in keeping the electroweak vacuum stable. Furthermore, this scenario is also capable of reheating the universe at the end of inflation. Though the issues of Dark Matter and Dark Energy, which dominate the late-time evolution of our universe, cannot be addressed within this framework, this model successfully describes the early universe dynamics according to the Big Bang model.

Flat universe with decaying cosmological constant	10.1140/epjp/i2014-14253-5	We have investigated the Robertson-Walker cosmological model with decaying vacuum density. We considered a special variation law in which the vacuum density. is proportional to the n-th power of the Hubble parameter H, i.e., Lambda alpha H-n (where n is a constant) (Phys. Rev. D 58, 043506 (1998)). Physical, kinematical and statefinder parameters are evaluated and their behaviors are discussed. It can be seen that the values of statefinders resemble the Lambda CDM model and, so, the model is in agreement with recent observations.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
Quintessence and effective RN de Sitter brane geometries	10.1140/epjc/s10052-014-3173-z	We revisit the effective space-time torsion curvature in a second order formalism, underlying the non-linear U(1) gauge dynamics, of a two form on a D-4-brane. The formalism incorporates a significant global NS two form into the theory via its perturbative coupling to a dynamical two form. In particular we explore the non-linear gauge dynamics on a D-4-brane in the presence of a non-trivial background metric. An effective de Sitter universe is shown to emerge on a vacuum created pair of (D (D) over bar) 3-branes by a local two form at the past horizon with the Big Bang. We obtain a number of 4D de Sitter quantum black holes with and without a propagating torsion. In a low energy limit the non-perturbative correction may be seen to be insignificant. The quantum black hole undergoes an expansion in the limit and identifies with the Einstein vacuum. Interestingly our analysis reveals a plausible quintessence (axion) on an anti-D-3-brane which may source the dark energy in a D-3-brane universe. Arguably a brane universe moves away from its anti-brane due to the conjectured repulsive gravity underlying the quintessence. It leads to a growth in the extra fifth dimension between a brane and an anti-brane, which may provide a clue to an accelerating universe as observed in cosmology.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Vacuum energy sequestering and cosmic dynamics	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.103523	We explicitly compute the dynamics of closed homogeneous and isotropic universes permeated by a single perfect fluid with a constant equation-of-state parameter w in the context of a recent reformulation of general relativity, proposed by Kaloper and Padilla [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 091304 (2014)], which prevents the vacuum energy from acting as a gravitational source. This is done using an iterative algorithm, taking as an initial guess the background cosmological evolution obtained using standard general relativity in the absence of a cosmological constant. We show that, in general, the impact of the vacuum energy sequestering mechanism on the dynamics of the universe is significant, except for the w = 1/3 case where the results are identical to those obtained in the context of general relativity with a null cosmological constant. We also show that there are well-behaved models in general relativity that do not have a well-behaved counterpart in the vacuum energy sequestering paradigm studied in this paper, highlighting the specific case of a quintessence scalar field with a linear potential.

Gravastar shadows	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.104013	Direct observation of black holes is one of the grand challenges in astronomy. If there are supercompact objects which possess unstable circular orbits of photons, however, it may be difficult to distinguish them from black holes by observing photons. As a model of supercompact objects, we consider a gravastar (gravitational-vacuum-star) which was originally proposed by Mazur and Mottola. For definiteness, we adopt a spherical thin-shell model of a gravastar developed by Visser andWiltshire, which connects interior de Sitter geometry and exterior Schwarzschild geometry. We find that unstable circular orbits of photons can appear around the gravastar. Then, we investigate the optical images of the gravastar possessing unstable circular orbits, assuming its optically transparent surface and two types of optical sources behind the gravastar: (i) an infinite optical plane and (ii) a companion star. The main feature of the image of (i) is that a bright disk and a dark thick ring surrounding the disk appear in the center of the region which would be completely dark if the compact object was not the gravastar but the Schwarzschild black hole. Also in case (ii), a small disk and arcs around the disk appear in the region which would be completely dark for the lensing image by the Schwarzschild black hole. Because characteristic images appear inside the gravastar in both cases, we could tell the difference between a black hole and a gravastar with high-resolution very-long-baseline-interferometry observations in the near future.

Cosmological General Relativity with Scale Factor and Dark Energy	10.1007/s10773-014-2138-1	In this paper the four-dimensional (4-D) space-velocity Cosmological General Relativity of Carmeli is developed by a general solution of the Einstein field equations. The Tolman metric is applied in the form ds(2) = g(mu nu)dx(mu)dx(nu) = tau(2)dv(2) - e(mu)dr(2) - R-2(d theta(2) + sin(2)theta d phi(2)), (1) where g(mu nu) is the metric tensor. We use comoving coordinates x(alpha) = (x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)) = (tau v, r, theta, phi), where tau is the Hubble-Carmeli time constant, v is the universe expansion velocity and r, theta and phi are the spatial coordinates. We assume that mu and R are each functions of the coordinates tau v and r. The vacuum mass density rho(Lambda) is defined in terms of a cosmological constant Lambda, rho(Lambda) equivalent to -Lambda/kappa tau(2), (2) where the Carmeli gravitational coupling constant kappa = 8 pi G/c(2)tau(2), where c is the speed of light in vacuum. This allows the definitions of the effective mass density rho(eff) equivalent to rho + rho(Lambda) (3) and effective pressure p(eff) equivalent to p - c tau rho(Lambda), (4) where rho is the mass density and p is the pressure. Then the energy-momentum tensor T-mu nu = tau(2)[(rho(eff) + p(eff)/c tau) u(mu)u(nu) - p(eff)/c tau g(mu nu)] (5) where u(mu) = (1, 0, 0, 0) is the 4-velocity. The Einstein field equations are taken in the form R-mu nu = kappa(T-mu nu - 1/2g(mu nu)T), (6) where R-mu nu is the Ricci tensor, kappa = 8 pi G/c(2)tau(2) is Carmeli's gravitation constant, where G is Newton's constant and the trace T = g(alpha beta)T(alpha beta). By solving the field equations (6) a space-velocity cosmology is obtained analogous to the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-time cosmology. We choose an equation of state such that p = w(e)c tau rho, (7) with an evolving state parameter w(e) (R-v) = w(0) + (1 - R-v) w(a), (8) where R-v = R-v(v) is the scale factor and w(0) and w(a) are constants. Carmeli's 4- D space- velocity cosmology is derived as a special case.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
A New Global 1-form in Lyra Geometric Cosmos Model	10.1007/s10773-014-2151-4	Dark energy phenomena has inspired lots of investigations on the cosmological constant problems. In order to understand its origin and properties as well as its impacts on universe's evolutions, there are many approaches to modify the well-known General Relativity, such as the Weyl-Lyra Geometry. In the well studied cosmology model within Lyra geometry, there is a problem that the first law of thermodynamics is violated. To unravel this issue, if we use the effective density and pressure in the Lyra cosmology model to preserve the first law of thermodynamics in the cosmos, the former 1-form (beta, 0, 0, 0) cannot give a proper vacuum behavior. In this paper, the auxiliary 1-form is modified to overcome this difficulty. It can be shown that the complex terms in the field equation derived from the regime of Lyra Geometric 3/2 phi(mu)phi(nu) - 3/4 delta(mu)(nu)phi(alpha)phi(alpha) with our new 1-form could behave just as the cosmological constant. This work can be regarded as a new exploration on a possible origin of the cosmological constant from a Lyra cosmology model.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Noether symmetries in a modified scalar-tensor gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.084033	The investigation of a cosmologically viable choice of a coupling function and scalar field potential is of great interest in scalar-tensor theories. The present work explores the form of the coupling function and scalar field potential using a Noether symmetry approach in a modified scalar-tensor gravity by including a nonminimal coupling of the scalar field with a torsion scalar. For this purpose, we consider locally rotational symmetric Bianchi I geometry in vacuum as well as nonvacuum cases and evaluate the corresponding conserved quantities for three different cases. By introducing cyclic variables, we find an exact solution of the corresponding field equations. We also discuss the expanding behavior of the resulting universe model through different cosmological parameters. Finally, we explore Noether gauge symmetry generators for Friedmann-Robertson-Walker and locally rotational symmetric Bianchi I universe models. It is concluded that in each case the symmetry generator as well as the conserved quantity exist, and the resulting solution is consistent with recent observations.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Models of universe with a polytropic equation of state: II. The late universe	10.1140/epjp/i2014-14222-0	We construct models of universe with a generalized equation of state having a linear component and a polytropic component. Concerning the linear equation of state , we assume . This equation of state describes radiation () or pressureless matter (). Concerning the polytropic equation of state , we remain very general allowing the polytropic constant k and the polytropic index n to have arbitrary values. In this paper, we consider negative indices n < 0. In this case, the polytropic component dominates the linear component in the late universe where the density is low. For , and , where g/m(3) is the cosmological density, we obtain a model of late universe describing the transition from the matter era to the dark energy era. The universe exists at any time in the future and there is no singularity. It undergoes an inflationary expansion (exponential acceleration) with the cosmological density g/m(3) (dark energy) on a timescale s. Coincidentally, we live close to the transition between the matter era and the dark energy era, corresponding to a size m and a time s. For , and , we obtain a model of cyclic universe appearing and disappearing periodically. If we were living in this universe, it would disappear in about 2.38 billion years. We make the connection between the early and the late universe and propose a simple equation describing the whole evolution of the universe. This leads to a model of universe that is eternal in past and future without singularity (aioniotic universe). It refines the standard CDM model by incorporating naturally a phase of early inflation and removing the primordial singularity (Big Bang). This model exhibits a nice ``symmetry{''} between the early and the late universe, the cosmological constant in the late universe playing the same role as the Planck constant in the early universe. The pressure is successively negative (early inflation), positive (radiation and matter eras), and negative again (late inflation). We interpret the cosmological constant as a fundamental constant of nature describing the ``cosmophysics{''} just like the Planck constant describes the ``microphysics{''}. The Planck density and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper and lower bounds differing by 122 orders of magnitude. The cosmological constant ``problem{''} may be a false problem. We determine the potential of the scalar field (quintessence, tachyon field) corresponding to the generalized equation of state . We also propose a unification of vacuum energy, radiation, and dark energy through the quadratic equation of state p/c(2) = -4 rho(2)/3 rho(P) + rho/3 - 4 rho(Lambda)/3.

The large-scale structure of vacuum	10.1142/S021827181442019X	The vacuum state in quantum field theory is known to exhibit an important number of fundamental physical features. In this work we explore the possibility that this state could also present a nontrivial spacetime structure on large scales. In particular, we will show that by imposing the renormalized vacuum energy-momentum tensor to be conserved and compatible with cosmological observations, the vacuum energy of sufficiently heavy fields behaves at late times as nonrelativistic matter rather than as a cosmological constant. In this limit, the vacuum state supports perturbations whose speed of sound is negligible and accordingly allows the growth of structures in the vacuum energy itself. This large-scale structure of vacuum could seed the formation of galaxies and clusters very much in the same way as cold dark matter does.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D

Cosmic acceleration without dark energy: background tests and thermodynamic analysis	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/10/042	A cosmic scenario with gravitationally induced particle creation is proposed. In this model the Universe evolves from an early to a late time de Sitter era, with the recent accelerating phase driven only by the negative creation pressure associated with the cold dark matter component. The model can be interpreted as an attempt to reduce the so-called cosmic sector (dark matter plus dark energy) and relate the two cosmic accelerating phases (early and late time de Sitter expansions). A detailed thermodynamic analysis including possible quantum corrections is also carried out. For a very wide range of the free parameters, it is found that the model presents the expected behavior of an ordinary macroscopic system in the sense that it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium in the long run (i.e., as it nears the second de Sitter phase). Moreover, an upper bound is found for the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the primordial de Sitter phase. Finally, when confronted with the recent observational data, the current `quasi'-de Sitter era, as predicted by the model, is seen to pass very comfortably the cosmic background tests.

Schwarzschild black hole in dark energy background	10.1007/s10509-014-2071-z	In this paper we present an exact solution of Einstein's field equations describing the Schwarzschild black hole in dark energy background. It is also regarded as an embedded solution that the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded into the dark energy space producing Schwarzschild-dark energy black hole. It is found that the space-time geometry of Schwarzschild-dark energy solution is non-vacuum Petrov type D in the classification of space-times. We study the energy conditions (like weak, strong and dominant conditions) for the energy-momentum tensor of the Schwarzschild-dark energy solution. We also find that the energy-momentum tensor of the Schwarzschild-dark energy solution violates the strong energy condition due to the negative pressure leading to a repulsive gravitational force of the matter field in the space-time. It is shown that the time-like vector field for an observer in the Schwarzschild-dark energy space is expanding, accelerating, shearing and non-rotating. We investigate the surface gravity and the area of the horizons for the Schwarzschild-dark energy black hole.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Analysis of QCD ghost F((R)over-tilde) gravity	10.1007/s10509-014-2064-y	We work on reconstruction scenario of recently proposed dark energy model call QCD ghost with modified Horava-Lifshitz F(R) gravity. We construct the model by taking well-known power law form of scale factor. It is found that this model satisfies the realistic condition. Also, the effective equation of state parameter shows quintom-like behavior from quintessence to phantom era by crossing the vacuum era of the universe. The squared speed of sound represents the instability of the model. In this context, the cosmological planes such as and statefinder show consistency with the accelerated expansion of the universe. We also investigate the generalized second law of thermodynamics on the Hubble horizon which remains valid for all cases of scale factor parameter n.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Late-time vacuum phase transitions: Connecting sub-eV scale physics with cosmological structure formation	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.063009	We show that a particular class of postrecombination phase transitions in the vacuum can lead to localized overdense regions on relatively small scales, roughly 10(6) to 10(10) M-circle dot, potentially interesting for the origin of large black hole seeds and for dwarf galaxy evolution. Our study suggests that this mechanism could operate over a range of conditions which are consistent with current cosmological and laboratory bounds. One byproduct of phase transition bubble-wall decay may be extra radiation energy density. This could provide an avenue for constraint, but it could also help reconcile the discordant values of the present Hubble parameter (H-0) and sigma(8) obtained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) fits and direct observational estimates. We also suggest ways in which future probes, including CMB considerations (e.g., early dark energy limits), 21-cm observations, and gravitational radiation limits, could provide more stringent constraints on this mechanism and the sub-eV scale beyond-standard-model physics, perhaps in the neutrino sector, on which it could be based. Late phase transitions associated with sterile neutrino mass and mixing may provide a way to reconcile cosmological limits and laboratory data, should a future disagreement arise.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dust Static Cylindrically Symmetric Solutions in f(R) Gravity		This paper is devoted to investigate non-vacuum solutions of cylindrically symmetric spacetime in the context of metric f(R) gravity. We take dust matter to find energy density of the universe. In particular, we find two exact solutions, which correspond to two f(R) models in each case. The first solution provides constant curvature while the second solution corresponds to non-constant curvature. The functions of the Ricci scalar and energy densities are evaluated in each case.

Hence a vacuum kink model, which is asymptotically flat, is presented.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Is the universe simpler than Lambda CDM?	10.1080/00107514.2014.919741	In the standard cosmological model, the Universe consists mainly of two invisible substances: vacuum energy with constant mass-density.v = /(8pG) (where is a ` cosmological constant' originally proposed by Einstein and G is Newton's gravitational constant) and cold dark matter (CDM) with mass density that is currently.DM, 0 0.3.v. This ` CDM' model has the virtue of simplicity, enabling straightforward calculation of the formation and evolution of cosmic structure against the backdrop of cosmic expansion. Here, we review apparent discrepancies with observations on small galactic scales, which CDM must attribute to complexity in the baryon physics of galaxy formation. Yet, galaxies exhibit structural scaling relations that evoke simplicity, presenting a clear challenge for formation models. In particular, tracers of gravitational potentials dominated by dark matter show a correlation between orbital size, R, and velocity, V, that can be expressed most simply as a characteristic acceleration, aDM 1km2s-2pc-1 3 x 10-9 cm s-2 0.2cv G.v, perhaps motivating efforts to find a link between localised and globalmanifestations of the Universe's dark components.

An optimal system and invariant solutions of dark energy models in cylindrically symmetric space-time	10.1140/epjp/i2014-14179-x	In this paper, we derive some new invariant solutions of dark energy models in cylindrically symmetric space-time. To quantify the deviation of pressure from isotropy, we introduce three different time-dependent skewness parameters along the spatial directions. The matter source consists of dark energy which is minimally interacting with perfect fluid. We use the symmetry analysis method for solving the non-linear partial differential equations (NLPDEs), which is more powerful than the classical methods of solving NLPDEs. The geometrical and kinematical features of the models and the behaviour of the anisotropy of dark energy are examined in detail.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
Dark matter, dark energy and the time evolution of masses in the universe	10.1142/S0217751X14440163	The traditional ``explanation{''} for the observed acceleration of the universe is the existence of a positive cosmological constant. However, this can hardly be a truly convincing explanation, as an expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density. So, it must be an approximation. This reminds us of the so-called fundamental ``constants{''} of nature. Recent and past measurements of the fine structure constant and of the proton-electron mass ratio suggest that basic quantities of the standard model, such as the QCD scale parameter, A(QCD), might not be conserved in the course of the cosmological evolution. The masses of the nucleons and of the atomic nuclei would be time-evolving. This can be consistent with General Relativity provided the vacuum energy itself is a dynamical quantity. Another framework realizing this possibility is QHD (Quantum Haplodynamics), a fundamental theory of bound states. If one assumes that its running couplings unify at the Planck scale and that such scale changes slowly with cosmic time, the masses of the nucleons and of the DM particles, including the cosmological term, will evolve with time. This could explain the dark energy of the universe.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Exciting physical problems for the near future	10.1002/asna.201412074	A review of the pseudo-complex theory of General Relativity will be given. The theory implies the existence of a minimal length. Modifying the variational principle did lead to a contribution of a dark energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side of the Einstein equations. A physical principle emerges from it: Mass not only curves the space but also modifies the vacuum properties around that mass. The dark energy contributions react back on the curvature of space, halting the collapse of any size of mass, and finally the event horizon disappears. For the dark energy contribution a model had to be used, due to the lack of a quantized quantum theory. We resumed some experimental predictions, neglecting the effects of the minimal length.

Pseudo-complex General Relativity and neutron stars	10.1002/asna.201412092	The pseudo-complex General Relativity, which includes a minimal length, is resumed and similarities to other theories are pointed out. For a zero minimal length the theory exhibits a remnant contribution, which is associated to a dark energy. It suggests the principle that a mass not only curves the space around it but also changes the vacuum properties, which in turn affect the metric. Some experimental predictions are shortly mentioned. The consequences of the presence of a dark energy are investigated for the case of neutron stars. It is shown that large masses of neutron stars are possible. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

How does pressure gravitate? Cosmological constant problem confronts observational cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/049	An important and long-standing puzzle in the history of modern physics is the gross inconsistency between theoretical expectations and cosmological observations of the vacuum energy density, by at least 60 orders of magnitude, otherwise known as the cosmo logical constant problem. A characteristic feature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but opposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General Relativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure. Therefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be responsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the context of the Gravitational A et h er proposal, using current cosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in the radiation era. Interestingly, we find that the best fit for anomalous pressure coupling is about half-way between General Relativity (GR), and Gravitational Aether (GA), if we include Planck together with WMAP and BICEP2 polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. Taken at face value, this data combination excludes both GR and GA at around the 3 sigma level. However, including higher resolution CMB observations ({''}highL{''}) or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) pushes the best fit closer to GR, excluding the Gravitational Aether solution to the cosmological constant problem at the 4-5 sigma level. This constraint effectively places a limit on the anomalous coupling to pressure in the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) expansion, zeta(4) = 0.105 +/- 0.049 (+highL CMB), or zeta(4) = 0.066 +/- 0.039 (+BAO). These represent the most precise measurement of this parameter to date, indicating a mild tension with GR (for Lambda CDM including tensors, with zeta(4) = 0), and also among different data sets.

Some remarks on the attractor behaviour in ELKO cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/020	Recent results on the dynamical stability of a system involving the interaction of the ELKO spinor field with standard matter in the universe have been reanalysed, and the conclusion is that such system does not exhibit isolated stable points that could alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem. When a constant parameter delta related to the potential of the ELKO field is introduced in the system however, stable fixed points are found for some specific types of interaction between the ELKO field and matter. Although the parameter delta is related to an unknown potential, in order to satisfy the stability conditions and also that the fixed points are real, the range of the constant parameter delta can be constrained for the present time and the coincidence problem can be alleviated for some specific interactions. Such restriction on the ELKO potential opens possibility to apply the ELKO field as a candidate to dark energy in the universe, and so explain the present phase of acceleration of the universe through the decay of the ELKO field into matter.

Baryonic matter perturbations in decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/08/004	We consider the perturbation dynamics for the cosmic baryon fluid and determine the corresponding power spectrum for a ?(t) CDM model in which a cosmological term decays into dark matter linearly with the Hubble rate. The model is tested by a joint analysis of data from supernovae of type Ia (SNIa) (Constitution and Union 2.1), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the position of the first peak of the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale-structure (LSS) data (SDSS DR7). While the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics is only marginally influenced by the baryons, there are modifications on the perturbative level if a separately conserved baryon fluid is included. Considering the present baryon fraction as a free parameter, we reproduce the observed abundance of the order of 5\% independently of the dark-matter abundance which is of the order of 32\% for this model. Generally, the concordance between background and perturbation dynamics is improved if baryons are explicitly taken into account.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Dark matter interacts with variable vacuum energy	10.1007/s10714-014-1769-0	We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker scenario with two interacting components, dark matter and variable vacuum energy densities, plus two decoupled components, one is a baryon term while the other behaves as a radiation component. We consider a linear interaction in the derivative dark component density. We apply the chi(2) method to the observational Hubble data for constraining the cosmological parameters and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation era for the model. It turns out that our model fulfills the severe bound of Omega(x) (z similar or equal to 1,100) < 0.009 at 2 sigma level, so is consistent with the recent analysis that include cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from Planck survey, the future constraints achievable by Euclid and CMBPol experiments, reported for the behavior of the dark energy at early times, and fulfills the stringent bound Omega(x) (z similar or equal to 10(10)) < 0.04 at 2 sigma level in the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch. We also examine the cosmic age problem at high redshift associated with the old quasar APM 08279+5255 and estimate the age of the universe today.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Why the R-h = ct cosmology is a vacuum solution in disguise and why all big bang models should be so	10.1093/mnras/stu859	Recently, Melia and his coworkers have proposed the so-called R-h = ct cosmology where the scale factor of the universe is a(t) alpha t and the spatial part is flat. Here, we look at this proposal from a fundamental angle. First, we note that Melia cosmology looks strikingly similar to the old Milne cosmology where a(t) alpha t and the spatial part is negatively curved. It is known that though Milne cosmology is a valid Friedmann solution, it actually corresponds to rho = 0 and can be described by a globally static Minkowski metric. Secondly, we note that for the Melia model, Ricci & Kretschmann scalars assume their perfect static form hinting that it too may tacitly correspond to vacuum. To compare Melia universe with the Milne universe, we express Melia metric too in curvature/Schwarzschild coordinates. Finally, by using the fact for such coordinate transformations dx'(4) = J dx(4), where J is the appropriate Jacobian, we explicitly show that Melia metric is static, which for k = 0 case implies vacuum. This shows that even apparently meaningful general relativistic solutions could be illusory as far as physical reality is concerned. And since Melia model is the unique solution for the big bang model, eventually, all big bang models could be mathematical illusions.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Cosmological scaling solutions for multiple scalar fields	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023516	The general k-essence Lagrangian for the existence of cosmological scaling solutions is derived in the presence of multiple scalar fields coupled to a barotropic perfect fluid. In addition to the scaling fixed point associated with the dynamics during the radiation and matter eras, we also obtain a scalar-field dominated solution relevant to dark energy and discuss the stability of them in the two-field setup. We apply our general results to a model of two canonical fields with coupled exponential potentials arising in string theory. Depending on model parameters and initial conditions, we show that the scaling matter-dominated epochs followed by an attractor with cosmic acceleration can be realized with/without the couplings to scalar fields. The different types of scaling solutions can be distinguished from each other by the evolution of the dark energy equation of state from high redshifts to today.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Entropic-force dark energy reconsidered	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023008	We reconsider the entropic-force model in which both kinds of Hubble terms, (H) over dot and H-2, appear in the effective dark energy (DE) density affecting the evolution of the main cosmological functions, namely, the scale factor, deceleration parameter, matter density, and growth of linear matter perturbations. However, we find that the entropic-force model is not viable at the background and perturbation levels due to the fact that the entropic formulation does not add a constant term in the Friedmann equations. On the other hand, if on mere phenomenological grounds we replace the (H) over dot dependence of the effective DE density with a linear term H without including a constant additive term, we find that the transition from deceleration to acceleration becomes possible, but the recent structure formation data strongly disfavor this cosmological scenario. Finally, we briefly compare the entropic-force models with some related DE models (based on dynamical vacuum energy) which overcome these difficulties and are compatible with the present observations.

Distributed SUSY breaking: dark energy, Newton's law and the LHC	10.1007/JHEP07(2014)034	We identify the underlying symmetry mechanism that suppresses the low-energy effective 4D cosmological constant within some 6D supergravity models, generically leading to results suppressed by powers of the KK scale, m (K K) (2) , relative to the much larger size, m(4), associated with mass-m particles localized in these models on codimension-2 branes. These models are examples for which the local conditions for unbroken supersymmetry can be satisfied locally everywhere within the extra dimensions, but are obstructed only by global conditions like flux quantization or by the mutual inconsistency of the boundary conditions required at the various branes. Consequently quantities (like vacuum energies) forbidden by supersymmetry cannot become nonzero until wavelengths of order the KK scale are integrated out, since only such long wavelength modes can see the entire space and so `know' that supersymmetry has broken. We verify these arguments by extending earlier rugby-ball calculations of one-loop vacuum energies within these models to more general pairs of branes within two warped extra dimensions. For the Standard Model confined to one of two otherwise identical branes, the predicted effective 4D vacuum energy density is of order rho(vac) similar or equal to C(mM (g) /4 pi M-p)(4) = C(5.6 x 10(-5) eV)(4), where M-g greater than or similar to 10 TeV (corresponding to extra-dimensional size r a parts per thousand(2) 1 mu m) and M (p) = 2.44 x 10(18) GeV are the 6D and 4D rationalized Planck scales, and m is the heaviest brane-localized particle. (For numerical purposes we take m to be the top-quark mass and take M (g) as small as possible, consistent with energy-loss bounds from supernovae.) C is a constant depending on the details of the bulk spectrum, which could easily be of order 500 for each of hundreds of fields in the bulk. The value C similar to 6 x 10(6) would give the observed Dark Energy density.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Bianchi type-I transit cosmological models with time dependent gravitational and cosmological constants	10.1007/s12648-014-0472-z	The present study deals with exact solutions of Einstein's field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological constants for a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time. To get deterministic solutions, we consider a law of variation of scale factor a(t) = root t(n)e(t) , which yields a time dependent deceleration parameter q = -1 + 2n/(n+t)(2), representing a class of models that generates a transition of the universe from early decelerated phase to the recent accelerating phase. We find that time dependent deceleration parameter is sensible for present day Universe and gives an earmark description of evolution of the universe. The gravitational constant G(t) is permitted to follow a power-law expansion which is suitable for present evolution of the universe. The cosmological constant Lambda(t) is obtained as a decreasing function of time and approaching a small positive value at present epoch which is corroborated by consequences from recent supernovae I-a observations. We also observed that our solution is stable. The physical significance of cosmological models has also been discussed.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Post-Planck constraints on interacting vacuum energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.90.023502	We present improved constraints on an interacting vacuum model using updated astronomical observations including the first data release from Planck. We consider a model with one dimensionless parameter, alpha, describing the interaction between dark matter and vacuum energy (with fixed equation of state w = -1). The background dynamics correspond to a generalized Chaplygin gas cosmology, but the perturbations have a zero sound speed. The tension between the value of the Hubble constant, H-0, determined by Planck data plus WMAP polarization (Planck+WP) and that determined by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) can be alleviated by energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum (alpha > 0). A positive a increases the allowed values of H-0 due to parameter degeneracy within the model using only cosmic microwave background data. Combining with additional data sets of including supernova type Ia (SN Ia) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), we can significantly tighten the bounds on alpha. Redshift-space distortions (RSD), which constrain the linear growth of structure, provide the tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined with Planck+WP, and prefer energy transfer from vacuum to dark matter (alpha < 0) which suppresses the growth of structure. Using the combined data sets of Planck + WP+Union2.1 + BAO + RSD, we obtain the constraint on a to be -0.083 < alpha < -0.006 (95\% C. L.), allowing low H-0 consistent with the measurement from 6dF Galaxy survey. This interacting vacuum model can alleviate the tension between RSD and Planck + WP in the Lambda CDM model for alpha < 0, or between HST measurements of H-0 and Planck+WP for alpha > 0, but not both at the same time.

THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PUZZLE: VACUUM ENERGIES FROM QCD TO DARK ENERGY	10.5506/APhysPolB.45.1269	The accelerating expansion of the Universe points to a small positive vacuum energy density and negative vacuum pressure. A strong candidate is the cosmological constant in Einstein's equations of General Relativity. The vacuum dark energy density extracted from astrophysics is 1056 times smaller than the value expected from the Higgs potential in Standard Model particle physics. The dark energy scale is however close to the range of possible values expected for the light neutrino mass. We investigate this physics in a simple toy model where the chirality of the neutrino is treated by analogy as an Ising-like ``spin{''} degree of freedom.	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B
ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE HIGGS BOSON IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE	10.5506/APhysPolB.45.1393	I review a recent analysis presented in F. Jegerlehner, Acta Phys. Pol. B 45, 1167 (2014); arXiv: 1305. 6652 [hep-ph], Acta Phys. Pol. B45, 1215 (2014). After the discovery of the Higgs particle the most relevant structures of the SM have been verified and for the first time we know all parameters of the SM within remarkable accuracy. Together with recent calculations of the SM renormalization group coefficients up to three loops, we can safely extrapolate running couplings high up in energy. Assuming that the SM is a low energy effective theory of a cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able to calculate the effective bare parameters of the underlying cutoff system. It turns out that the effective bare mass term changes sign not far below the Planck scale, which means that in the early universe the SM was in the symmetric phase. The sign-flip, which is a result of a conspiracy between the SM couplings and their screening/antiscreening behavior, triggers the Higgs mechanism. Above the Higgs phase transition the bare mass term in the Higgs potential must have had a large positive value, enhanced by the quadratic divergence of the bare Higgs mass. Likewise the quartically enhanced positive vacuum energy density is present in the symmetric phase. The Higgs system thus provides the large dark energy density in the early universe, which triggers slow-roll inflation, i.e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field. Reheating is dominated by the decay of the heavy Higgses into (in the symmetric phase) massless top/anti-top quark pairs. The Higgs mechanism stops inflation and the subsequent electroweak phase transition provides the masses to the SM particles in proportion to their coupling strength. The previously most abundantly produced particles are now the heaviest and decay into the lighter ones, by cascading down the CKM-element matrix from top and bottom to normal matter. Baryon-number B violating interactions are naturally provided by Weinberg's set of close-by dimension 6 four-fermion effective interactions. Since matter is produced originating from the primordial heavy Higgs fields via C and CF violating decays we have actually a new scenario which possibly could explain the baryon-asymmetry essentially in terms of SM physics.

Galactic cluster in the presence of dark energy	10.1134/S0202289314030049	A solution for cosmological expansion in the presence of dark matter is presented, and observational results from which a conclusion on the present value of the cosmological constant is obtained, are discussed. A solution is obtained for hydrodynamic outflow of polytropic gas from a gravitating center, in the presence of uniform Dark Energy (DE). The antigravity of DE is enlightening the outflow and makes the outflow possible at smaller initial temperature at the same density. The main property of the wind in the presence of DE is its unlimited acceleration after passing the critical point. Applying this solution to winds from galaxy clusters, we suggest that a collision of a strongly accelerated wind with another galaxy cluster, or with another galactic cluster wind, could lead to the formation of highest energy cosmic rays.

The cosmological constant problem and re-interpretation of time	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2014.04.024	We abandon the interpretation that time is a global parameter in quantum mechanics, replace it by a quantum dynamical variable playing the role of time. This operational re-interpretation of time provides a solution to the cosmological constant problem. The expectation value of the zero-point energy under the new time variable vanishes. The fluctuation of the vacuum energy as the leading contribution to the gravitational effect gives a correct order to the observed ``dark energy{''}. The ``dark energy{''} as a mirage is always seen comparable with the matter energy density by an observer using the internal clock time. Conceptual consequences of the re-interpretation of time are also discussed. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
High scale inflation, model-independent string axion, and QCD axion with domain wall number one	10.1016/j.physletb.2014.05.033	The recent BICEP2 result shows that the Universe once has gone through the vacuum with the GUT scale energy density. The implied high scale inflation nullifies the dilution idea of topological defects, strings and domain walls, of the axionic system. In particular, domain walls are disastrous if the domain wall problem with Npw > 2 is present. We argue that the model-independent axion in string compactification with the anomalous U(1)ga gauge symmetry resolves the domain wall problem naturally with a symmetry principle. C) 2014 The Author.

We investigate the vacuum stability, coupling perturbativity, and correct dark matter abundance in this model by use of current experimental data. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A small cosmological constant due to non-perturbative quantum effects	10.1088/0264-9381/31/12/125006	We propose an explanation for the `unnatural smallness' of the cosmological constant, arguing that the stress-energy tensor of the Standard Model should be given by < T-mu nu > = rho(vac) eta(mu nu)., with a vacuum energy.vac that differs from the usual `dimensional analysis' result by an exponentially small factor associated with non-perturbative effects. We substantiate our proposal by a rigorous analysis of a toy model, namely the two-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. The stress energy operator is constructed concretely via the operator-product-expansion, and the inherent ambiguities in its construction are carefully examined. Our result for the vacuum energy is then obtained from the assumptions that ( a) the OPE-coefficients have an analytic dependence on g, which we propose to be a generic feature of QFT, and that (b) the vacuum energy vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory. Our result can also be interpreted as saying that, while the semi-classical Einstein's equation can be fulfilled in Minkowski space at the perturbative level, it cannot at the non-perturbative level. Extrapolating our result from the Gross-Neveu model to the Standard Model, one would expect to find rho(vac) similar to A(4)e(-O(1)/g2), where A is an energy scale such as A = M-H, and g is a gauge coupling such as g(2)/4 pi = alpha EW. Assuming this extrapolation is justified, the exponentially small factor due to non- perturbative effects would explain why this quantity is tiny, instead of strictly zero.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Evolution of the universe in entropic cosmologies via different formulations	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.123501	We study two types of entropic-force models in a homogeneous, isotropic, spatially flat, matter-dominated universe. The first type is a Lambda(t) type similar to Lambda(t)CDM (varying-lambda cold dark matter) models in which both the Friedmann equation and the acceleration equation include an extra driving term. The second type is a BV type similar to bulk viscous models in which the acceleration equation includes an extra driving term but the Friedmann equation does not. In order to examine the two types systematically, we consider an extended entropic-force model that includes a Hubble parameter (H) term and a constant term in entropic-force terms. The H term is derived from a volume entropy, whereas the constant term is derived from an entropy proportional to the square of an area entropy. Based on the extended entropic-force model, we examine four models obtained from combining the H and constant terms with the Lambda(t) and BV types. The four models agree well with the observed supernova data and describe the background evolution of the late universe properly. However, the evolution of first-order density perturbations is different in each of the four models, especially for low redshift, assuming that an effective sound speed is negligible. The Lambda(t) type is found to be consistent with the observed growth rate of clustering, in contrast with the BV type examined in this study. A unified formulation is proposed as well, in order to systematically examine density perturbations of the two types.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Apparent ghosts and spurious degrees of freedom in non-local theories	10.1016/j.physletb.2014.04.024	Recent work has shown that non-local modifications of the Einstein equations can have interesting cosmological consequences and can provide a dynamical origin for dark energy, consistent with existing data. At first sight these theories are plagued by ghosts. We show that these apparent ghost-like instabilities do not describe actual propagating degrees of freedom, and there is no issue of ghost-induced quantum vacuum decay. (C) 2014 The Authors.

On dark degeneracy and interacting models	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/06/010	Cosmological background observations cannot fix the dark energy equation of state, which is related to a degeneracy in the definition of the dark sector components. tilere we show that this degeneracy can be broken at perturbation level by imposing two observational properties on dark matter. First, dark matter is defined as the clustering component we observe in large scale structures. This definition is meaningful only if dark energy is unperturbed, which is achieved if we additionally assume, as a second condition, that dark matter is cold, i.e. non-relativistic. As a consequence, dark energy models with equation-of-state parameter -1 <= omega < 0 are reduced to two observationally distinguishable classes with omega = -1, equally competitive when tested against observations. The first comprises the ACDM model with constant dark energy density. The second consists of interacting models with an energy flux from dark energy to dark matter.

THE STANDARD MODEL AS A LOW-ENERGY EFFECTIVE THEORY: WHAT IS TRIGGERING THE HIGGS MECHANISM?	10.5506/APhysPolB.45.1167	The discovery of the Higgs by ATLAS and CMS at the LHC not only provided the last missing building block of the electroweak Standard Model, the mass of the Higgs has been found to have a very peculiar value, about 126 GeV, which is such that vacuum stability may be extending up to the Planck scale. We emphasize the consequences for the running masses and we reconsider the role of quadratic divergences. A change of sign of the coefficient of the quadratically divergent terms, showing up at about mu(0) similar to 1.4 x 10(16) GeV, may be understood as a first order phase transition restoring the symmetric phase in the early universe, while its large negative values at lower scales trigger the Higgs mechanism. Running parameters evolve in such a way that the symmetry is restored two orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. As a consequence, the electroweak phase transition takes place near the scale mu(0) much closer to the Planck scale than anticipated so far. The SM Higgs system and its phase transition plays a key role for the inflation of the early universe. Dark energy triggering inflation is provided by the huge bare Higgs mass term and a Higgs induced vacuum density in the symmetric phase at times before the electroweak phase transition takes place.

HIGGS INFLATION AND THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT	10.5506/APhysPolB.45.1215	We discuss the impact of the Higgs. discovery and its revealing a very peculiar value for the Higgs mass. It turns out that the Higgs not only induces the masses of all SM particles, the Higgs, given its special mass value, is the natural candidate for the inflaton and, in fact, is ruling the evolution of the early universe, by providing the necessary dark energy which remains the dominant energy density. In a previous paper, I have shown that running couplings not only allow us to extrapolate SM physics up to the Planck scale, but equally important they are triggering the Higgs mechanism when the universe cools down to lower temperatures. This is possible by the fact that the bare mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign at about mu(0) similar or equal to 1.4 x 10(16) GeV and in the symmetric phase is enhanced by quadratic terms in the Planck mass. The huge Higgs mass term together with a Higgs induced vacuum energy play a key role in triggering inflation. We show how different terms contributing to the Higgs Lagrangian are affecting inflation. Miraculously, the huge difference between bare and renormalized cosmological constant is nullified either by the running of the SM couplings or by vacuum rearrangement somewhat before the Higgs phase transition takes place. This solves the notorious cosmological constant problem. The role of the Higgs in reheating and baryogenesis is discussed.	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B
Evolution of vacuum fluctuations generated during and before inflation	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.103536	We calculate the time evolution of the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for a minimally coupled massless scalar field in cosmological spacetimes, with an application to dark energy in mind. We first study the evolution from inflation until the present, fixing the Bunch-Davies initial condition. The energy density of a quantum field evolves as rho similar to 3(HIH)(2)/32 pi(2) in the matter-dominated (MD) period, where HI and H are the Hubble parameters during inflation and at each moment. Its equation of state, w = rho/p, changes from a negative value to w = 1/3 in the radiation-dominated (RD) period, and from 1= 3 to w = 0 in the MD period. We then consider possible effects of a Planckian universe, which may have existed before inflation, by assuming there was another inflation with the Hubble parameterH(P)(> H-I). In this case, modes with wavelengths longer than the current horizon radius are mainly amplified, and the energy density of a quantum field grows with time as rho similar to (a/a(0))(HPH)(2)/32 in the MD period, where a and a(0) are the scale factors at each time and at present. Hence, ifHP is of the order of the Planck scale M-P,M- rho becomes comparable to the critical density 3(MPH)(2) at the present time. The contribution to rho from the long wavelength fluctuations generated before the ordinary inflation has w = -1= 3 in the free field approximation. We mention a possibility that interactions further amplify the energy density and change the equation of state.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Instability of global de Sitter space to particle creation	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.104038	We show that global de Sitter space is unstable to particle creation, even for a massive free field theory with no self-interactions. The O(4, 1) de Sitter invariant state is a definite phase coherent superposition of particle and antiparticle solutions in both the asymptotic past and future and, therefore, is not a true vacuum state. In the closely related case of particle creation by a constant, uniform electric field, a time symmetric state analogous to the de Sitter invariant one is constructed, which is also not a stable vacuum state. We provide the general framework necessary to describe the particle creation process, the mean particle number, and dynamical quantities such as the energy-momentum tensor and current of the created particles in the de Sitter and electric field backgrounds respectively in real time, establishing the connection to kinetic theory. We compute the energy-momentum tensor for adiabatic vacuum states in de Sitter space initialized at early times in global S-3 sections and show that particle creation in the contracting phase results in exponentially large energy densities at later times, necessitating an inclusion of their backreaction effects and leading to large deviation of the spacetime from global de Sitter space before the expanding phase can begin.

Quantum vacuum instability of ``eternal{''} de Sitter space	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.104039	The Euclidean or Bunch-Davies O(4, 1) invariant state for quantum fields in global de Sitter space is shown to be unstable to small perturbations, even for a massive free field with no self-interactions. There are perturbations of this state with energy density that is arbitrarily small at early times, is exponentially blueshifted in the contracting phase of ``eternal{''} de Sitter space, and becomes large enough to disturb the classical geometry through the semi-classical Einstein equations at later times. In the closely analogous case of a constant, uniform electric field, a time symmetric state equivalent to the de Sitter invariant one is constructed, which is also not a stable vacuum state under perturbations. The role of a quantum anomaly in the growth of perturbations and symmetry breaking is emphasized in both cases. In de Sitter space, the same results are obtained either directly from the renormalized stress tensor of a massive scalar field, or for massless conformal fields of any spin, more directly from the effective action and stress tensor associated with the conformal trace anomaly. The anomaly stress tensor shows that states invariant under the O(4) subgroup of the de Sitter group are also unstable to perturbations of lower spatial symmetry, implying that both the O(4, 1) isometry group and its O(4) subgroup are broken by quantum fluctuations. Potential consequences of this result for cosmology and the problem of vacuum energy are discussed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Scalar-field theory of dark matter	10.1142/S0217751X14500742	We develop a theory of dark matter based on a previously proposed picture, in which a complex vacuum scalar field makes the universe a superfluid, with the energy density of the superfluid giving rise to dark energy, and variations from vacuum density giving rise to dark matter. We formulate a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation to describe the superfluid, treating galaxies as external sources. We study the response of the superfluid to the galaxies, in particular, the emergence of the dark-matter galactic halo, contortions during galaxy collisions and the creation of vortices due to galactic rotation.

Dark energy from holographic theories with hyperscaling violation	10.1007/JHEP05(2014)089	We show that analytical continuation maps scalar solitonic solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity, interpolating between an hyperscaling violating and an Anti de Sitter (AdS) region, in flat FLRW cosmological solutions sourced by a scalar field. We generate in this way exact FLRW solutions that can be used to model cosmological evolution driven by dark energy (a quintessence field) and usual matter. In absence of matter, the flow from the hyperscaling violating regime to the conformal AdS fixed point in holographic models corresponds to cosmological evolution from power-law expansion at early cosmic times to a de Sitter (dS) stable fixed point at late times. In presence of matter, we have a scaling regime at early times, followed by an intermediate regime in which dark energy tracks matter. At late times the solution exits the scaling regime with a sharp transition to a dS spacetime. The phase transition between hyperscaling violation and conformal fixed point observed in holographic gravity has a cosmological counterpart in the transition between a scaling era and a dS era dominated by the energy of the vacuum.

Cosmological constant from the emergent gravity perspective	10.1142/S0218271814300110	Observations indicate that our universe is characterized by a late-time accelerating phase, possibly driven by a cosmological constant Lambda, with the dimensionless parameter Lambda L-P(2) similar or equal to 10(-122), where L-P - (G (h) over bar /c(3))(1/2) is the Planck length. In this review, we describe how the emergent gravity paradigm provides a new insight and a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. After reviewing the necessary background material, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for solving the cosmological constant problem. We show that these conditions are naturally satisfied in the emergent gravity paradigm in which (i) the field equations of gravity are invariant under the addition of a constant to the matter Lagrangian and (ii) the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant in the solution. The numerical value of this integration constant can be related to another dimensionless number (called CosMIn) that counts the number of modes inside a Hubble volume that cross the Hubble radius during the radiation and the matter-dominated epochs of the universe. The emergent gravity paradigm suggests that CosMIn has the numerical value 4 pi, which, in turn, leads to the correct, observed value of the cosmological constant. Further, the emergent gravity paradigm provides an alternative perspective on cosmology and interprets the expansion of the universe itself as a quest towards holographic equipartition. We discuss the implications of this novel and alternate description of cosmology.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Quasinormal Modes of Spherical Symmetrical Black Hole with x-Matter	10.1007/s10773-013-1941-4	In this paper, we use expansion method with eikonal limit to calculate the scalar and Dirac quasinormal modes of black hole with x-matter, which is a spherical symmetrical vacuum black hole in a brane-world scenario. The spacetime includes x-matter as the dark energy. From the results, we find the x-matter accelerates quasinormal frequency and slows damping rate of amplitude.

Metastability of the false vacuum in a Higgs-seesaw model of dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.085023	In a recently proposed Higgs-seesaw model the observed scale of dark energy results from a metastable false vacuum energy associated with mixing of the standard model Higgs particle and a scalar associated with new physics at the scale of unification or the Planck scale. Here we address the issue of how to ensure metastability of this state over cosmological time. We consider new tree-level operators, the presence of a thermal bath of hidden sector particles, and quantum corrections to the effective potential. We find that in the thermal scenario many additional light degrees of freedom are typically required unless coupling constants are somewhat fine-tuned. However quantum corrections arising from as few as one additional light scalar field can provide the requisite support. We also briefly consider implications of late-time vacuum decay for the perdurance of observed structures in the universe in this model.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Superhorizon entanglement entropy from particle decay in inflation	10.1007/JHEP04(2014)055	In inflationary cosmology all particle states decay as a consequence of the lack of kinematic thresholds. The decay of an initial single particle state yields an entangled quantum state of the product particles. We generalize and extend a manifestly unitary field theoretical method to obtain the time evolution of the quantum state. We consider the decay of a light scalar field with mass M << H with a cubic coupling in de Sitter space-time. Radiative corrections feature an infrared enhancement manifest as poles in Delta = M-2/3II(2) and we obtain the quantum state in an expansion in Delta . To leading order in Delta the pure state density matrix describing the decay of a particle with sub-horizon wavevector is dominated by the emission of superhorizon quanta, describing emphentanglement between superhorizon and subhorizon fluctuations and correlations across the horizon. Tracing over the superhorizon degrees of freedom yields a mixed state density matrix from which we obtain the entanglement entropy. Asymptotically this entropy grows with the physical volume as a consequence of more modes of the decay products crossing the Hubble radius. A generalization to localized wave packets is provided. The cascade decay of single particle states into many particle states is discussed. We conjecture on possible impact of these results on non-gaussianity and on the ``low multipole anomalies{''} of the CMB	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Virtual gravitational dipoles: The key for the understanding of the Universe?	10.1016/j.dark.2014.03.002	Before the end of this decade, three competing experiments (ALPHA, AEGIS and GBAR) will discover if atoms of antihydrogen fall up or down. We wonder what the major changes in astrophysics and cosmology would be if it is experimentally confirmed that antimatter falls upward. The key point is: if antiparticles have negative gravitational charge, the quantum vacuum, well established in the Standard Model of Particles and Fields, contains virtual gravitational dipoles. The main conclusions are: (1) the physical vacuum enriched with gravitational dipoles is compatible with a cyclic universe alternatively dominated by matter and antimatter, without initial singularity and without the need for cosmic inflation; (2) the virtual dipoles might explain the phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy. While what we have presented is still far from a complete theory, hopefully it can stimulate a radically different and potentially important way of thinking. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Particle creation in a f(R) theory with cosmological constraints	10.1007/s10714-014-1699-x	In this paper we study the creation of super-massive real scalar particles in the framework of a f (R) = R - beta/R-n modified gravity theory, with parameters constrained by observational data. The analysis is restrict to a homogeneous and isotropic flat and radiation dominated universe. We compare the results to the standard Einstein gravity with cosmological constant (Lambda CDM model), and we show that the total number density of created particles in the f (R) model is very close to the standard case. Another interesting result is that the spectrum of created particles is beta independent at early times.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
A Dynamic Dark Information Energy Consistent with Planck Data	10.3390/e16041902	The 2013 cosmology results from the European Space Agency Planck spacecraft provide new limits to the dark energy equation of state parameter. Here we show that Holographic Dark Information Energy (HDIE), a dynamic dark energy model, achieves an optimal fit to the published datasets where Planck data is combined with other astrophysical measurements. HDIE uses Landauer's principle to account for dark energy by the energy equivalent of information, or entropy, of stellar heated gas and dust. Combining Landauer's principle with the Holographic principle yields an equation of state parameter determined solely by star formation history, effectively solving the ``cosmic coincidence problem{''}. While HDIE mimics a cosmological constant at low red-shifts, z < 1, the small difference from a cosmological constant expected at higher red-shifts will only be resolved by the next generation of dark energy instrumentation. The HDIE model is shown to provide a viable alternative to the main cosmological constant/vacuum energy and scalar field/quintessence explanations.	ENTROPY
Vacuum expansion in arbitrary-gauge Lyra geometry	10.1139/cjp-2012-0279	We propose a cosmological model containing a cosmological term in arbitrary gauge in Lyra's geometry. In the absence of matter fields (such as radiation or baryonic), a constant cosmological term does not lead to the de Sitter universe as it is seen in Riemannian geometry, while a time-varying cosmological term can drive the universe into an accelerated expansion.

THE INFLUENCE OF AN INTERACTING VACUUM ENERGY ON THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE OF A STAR FLUID	10.1142/S0218271814500333	To explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, models with interacting dark components has been considered in the literature. Generally, the dark energy component is physically interpreted as the vacuum energy. However, at the other side of the same coin, the influence of the vacuum energy in the gravitational collapse is a topic of scientific interest. Based in a simple assumption on the collapsed rate of the matter fluid density that is altered by the inclusion of a vacuum energy component that interacts with the matter fluid, we study the final fate of the collapse process.

SOLAR SYSTEM TESTS OF f (R) GRAVITY	10.1142/S0218271814500369	In this paper, we revisit the solar system tests of f(R) gravity. When the sun sits in a vacuum, the field f' is light, which leads to a metric different from the observations. We reobtain this result in a simpler way by directly focusing on the equations of motion for f(R) gravity in the Jordan frame (JF). The discrepancy between the metric in the f(R) gravity and the observations can be alleviated by the chameleon mechanism. The implications from the chameleon mechanism on the functional form f(R) are discussed. Considering the analogy of the solar system tests to the false vacuum decay problem, the effective potentials in different cases are also explored. The combination of analytic and numerical approaches enables us to ascertain whether an f(R) model can pass the solar system tests or not.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Schwarzschild-NUT solution in modified teleparallel gravity theory	10.1007/s10509-013-1769-7	Spherically symmetric tetrad field is applied to the field equation of modified teleparallel gravity theory. Some constraints are assumed on the resulting non-linear partial differential equations. Exact vacuum solution is derived with two constants of integration. The derived solution has a vanishing scalar torsion, i.e., T=T (mu) (nu I >>) S (mu) (nu I >>) =0 and its space-time is axially symmetric. It is shown that this solution can be rewritten as a product of three matrices, two local Lorentz transformations and one diagonal tetrad field. The local Lorentz transformations represent ``so(3){''} and a boost transformation and the diagonal tetrad reproduce the same metric field of the original tetrad.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Reconstruction of ghost scalar fields	10.1140/epjp/i2014-14042-2	In the literature, a large number of approaches have been done to reconstruct the potential and dynamics of the scalar fields by establishing a connection between holographic/Ricci/new agegraphic/ghost energy density and a scalar field model of dark energy. In most of these attempts, the analytical form of the potentials in terms of the scalar field have not been reconstructed due to the complexity of the equations involved. In the present work, we establish a correspondence between ghost dark energy and quintessence, tachyon and dilaton scalar field models in anisotropic Bianchi type-I universe to reconstruct the dynamics of these scalar fields	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
On the Vainshtein mechanism in the minimal model of massive gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2014/03/043	We reinvestigate the fate of the Vainhstein mechanism in the minimal model of dRGT massive gravity. As the latter is characterised by the complete absence of interactions in the decoupling limit, we study their structure at higher energies. We show that in static spherically symmetric configurations, the lowest energy scale of interactions is pushed up to the Planck mass. This fact points towards an absence of Vainshtein mechanism in this framework, but does not prove it. By resorting to the exact vacuum equations of motion, we show that there is indeed an obstruction that precludes any recovery of General Relativity under the conditions of stationarity and spherical symmetry. However, we argue that the latter are too restrictive and might miss some important physical phenomena. Indeed, we point out that in generic non spherically symmetric or time-dependent situations, interactions arising at energies arbitrarily close to the energy scale of the decoupling limit reappear. This leads us to question whether the small degree of spherical symmetry breaking in the solar system can be sufficient to give rise to a successful Vainshtein mechanism.

Then, we reconstruct the potential of the scalar field which describe the generalized cosmic Chaplygin cosmology. In the special case we obtain time-dependent energy density and study cosmological parameters. We find stability condition of this model which is depend on cosmic parameter.

MODELING DARK ENERGY THROUGH AN ISING FLUID WITH NETWORK INTERACTIONS	10.1142/S0218271814500230	We show that the dark energy (DE) effects can be modeled by using an Ising perfect fluid with network interactions, whose low redshift equation of state (EoS), i.e. w(0), becomes w(0) = -1 as in the ACDM model. In our picture, DE is characterized by a barotropic fluid on a lattice in the equilibrium configuration. Thus, mimicking the spin interaction by replacing the spin variable with an occupational number, the pressure naturally becomes negative. We find that the corresponding EoS mimics the effects of a variable DE term, whose limiting case reduces to the cosmological constant.. This permits us to avoid the introduction of a vacuum energy as DE source by hand, alleviating the coincidence and fine tuning problems. We find fairly good cosmological constraints, by performing three tests with supernovae la (SNela), baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. Finally, we perform the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) selection criteria, showing that our model is statistically favored with respect to the Chevallier-Polarsky-Linder (CPL) parametrization.

Constraints on a decomposed dark fluid with constant adiabatic sound speed by jointing the geometry test and growth rate after Planck data	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.043511	In this paper, a unified dark fluid with constant adiabatic sound speed is decomposed into cold dark matter interacting with vacuum energy. Based on a Markov-chain Monte Carlo method, we constrain this model by jointing the geometry and dynamical measurement. The geometry test includes cosmic microwave background radiation from Planck, baryon acoustic oscillation, and type-Ia supernovae; the dynamic measurement is f sigma(8)(z) data points, which is obtained from the growth rate via redshift space distortion, and sigma(8)(z) is the root-mean-square amplitude of the density contrast delta at the comoving 8h(-1) Mpc scale. The jointed constraint shows that alpha = 0.000662(-0.000662)(+0.000173) and alpha = 0.824(-0.0166)(+0.0128). The CMB and matter power spectra are both similar for the case of alpha = mean value and that of alpha = 0. However, the evolutionary curves of f sigma(8)(z) are different. This means that, to some extent, the data points of the growth rate could break the degeneracy of the dark energy models.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Phantom dark energy from nonlocal infrared modifications of general relativity	10.1103/PhysRevD.89.043008	We discuss the cosmological consequences of a model based on a nonlocal infrared modification of Einstein equations. We find that the model generates a dynamical dark energy that can account for the presently observed value of Omega(DE), without introducing a cosmological constant. Tuning a free mass parameter m to a value m similar or equal to 0.67H(0), we reproduce the observed value Omega(DE) similar or equal to 0.68. This leaves us with no free parameter, and we then get a pure prediction for the equation of state parameter of dark energy. Writing w(DE)(a) = w(0) + (1 - a)w(a), we find w(0) similar or equal to - 1.04 and w(a) similar or equal to -0.02, consistent with the Planck data and on the phantom side. We also argue that nonlocal equations of the type that we propose must be understood as purely classical effective equations, such as those derived in semiclassical gravity for the in- in matrix elements of the metric. As such, any apparent ghost instability in such equations only affects the classical dynamics, but there is no propagating degree of freedom associated to the ghost and no issue of ghostinduced quantum vacuum decay.

Revisiting the vacuum energy scenario from the renormalization group method of the QFT theory	10.1140/epjp/i2014-14027-1	In this paper the vacuum energy scenario (or time-dependent cosmological constant) from the renormalization group (RG) equation is studied. By considering the renormalization group scale described by the Hubble parameter, we apply the current observational data to constrain this RG dark energy model. Concretely, the different combinations of cosmic observational data, including the kinematical and the dynamical part, are investigated to constrain the RG model. For comparison we also consider the cosmic constraints on the dark model by taking the Ricci scalar as the renormalization group scale. In addition, we compare these two RG dark energy models with the cosmological constant.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
Evolution of the Universe with Time Varying Constants	10.6122/CJP.52.101	In this paper, we discuss the evolution of the universe by considering Lambda and G as time varying constants with different choices of Lambda. We choose the polytropic equation of state as the total energy content and find approximate values of the constant parameters for the cold dark matter and radiation components of the fluid of the universe. We also mention different possibilities for the constant parameters in order to interpret quintessence, vacuum, and phantom dark energy phases of the universe. Also, we find the conditions on the different constant parameters under which the behavior of G and Lambda is consistent with the present observations. Finally, we calculate the statefinder parameters in this scenario.	CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
A UNIFIED DARK ENERGY MODEL FROM A VANISHING SPEED OF SOUND WITH EMERGENT COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT	10.1142/S0218271814500126	The problem of the cosmic acceleration is here revisited by using the fact that the adiabatic speed of sound can be assumed to be negligible small. Within the context of general relativity, the total energy budget is recovered under the hypothesis of a vanishing speed of sound by assuming the existence of one fluid only. We find a cosmological model which reproduces the main results of the Lambda CDM paradigm at late-times, showing an emergent cosmological constant, which is not at all related with the vacuum energy term. As a consequence, the model presented here behaves as a unified dark energy (DE) model.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D

We also discuss some of the thermodynamic features of this model. In order to constrain the free parameters of the model we carry out a joint statistical analysis involving observational data from current type Ia supernovae, recent estimates of the cosmic microwave background shift parameter and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements. Finally, we adopt a theoretical method to derive the coupled scalar field version for this non-equilibrium decaying vacuum accelerating cosmology.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Two-fluid atmosphere from decelerating to accelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker dark energy models	10.1007/s12648-013-0399-9	Evolution of dark energy parameter within scope of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model filled with perfect fluid and dark energy components is studied by generalizing recent results. The two sources are claimed to interact minimally so that their energy momentum tensors are conserved separately. The conception of time-dependent deceleration parameter with some suitable assumption yields an average scale factor , with alpha and n being positive arbitrary constants. For 0 < n a parts per thousand currency sign 1, this generates a class of accelerating models while for n > 1, the models of universe exhibit phase transition from early decelerating phase to present accelerating phase which is supported by results from recent astrophysical observations. It is observed that the transition red shift (z (t) ) for our derived model with q (0) = -0.73 is a parts per thousand...0.32. This is in good agreement with cosmological observations in literature. Some physical and geometric properties of this model along with physical acceptability of cosmological solutions have been discussed in detail.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Effective equation of state for running vacuum: `mirage' quintessence and phantom dark energy	10.1093/mnras/stt2135	Past analyses of the equation of state (EoS) of the Dark Energy (DE) were not incompatible with a phantom phase near our time. This has been the case in the years of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations, in combination with the remaining cosmological observables. Such situations did not completely disappear from the data collected from the Planck satellite mission. In it the EoS analysis may still be interpreted as suggesting omega(D) less than or similar to -1, and so a mildly evolving DE cannot be discarded. In our opinion, the usual ansatzs made on the structure of the EoS for dynamical DE models (e.g. quintessence and the like) is too simplified. In this work, we examine in detail some of these issues and suggest that a general class of models with a dynamical vacuum energy density could explain the persistent phantom anomaly, despite this there is no trace of real phantom behaviour in them. The spurious or `mirage' effect is caused by an attempt to describe them as if the DE would be caused by fundamental phantom scalar fields. Remarkably, the effective DE behaviour can also appear as quintessence in transit to phantom, or vice versa.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Mysteries of R (ik)=0: A novel paradigm in Einstein's theory of gravitation	10.1007/s11467-013-0358-0	Despite a century-long effort, a proper energy-stress tensor of the gravitational field, could not have been discovered. Furthermore, it has been discovered recently that the standard formulation of the energy-stress tensor of matter, suffers from various inconsistencies and paradoxes, concluding that the tensor is not consistent with the geometric formulation of gravitation [Astrophys. Space Sci., 2009, 321: 151; Astrophys. Space Sci., 2012, 340: 373]. This perhaps hints that a consistent theory of gravitation should not have any bearing on the energy-stress tensor. It is shown here that the so-called ``vacuum{''} field equations R (ik) = 0 do not represent an empty spacetime, and the energy, momenta and angular momenta of the gravitational and the matter fields are revealed through the geometry, without including any formulation thereof in the field equations. Though, this novel discovery appears baffling and orthogonal to the usual understanding, is consistent with the observations at all scales, without requiring the hypothetical dark matter, dark energy or inflation. Moreover, the resulting theory circumvents the long-standing problems of the standard cosmology, besides explaining some unexplained puzzles.	FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS
NNMSM type-II and -III	10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2696-z	We suggest two types of extension of the standard model, which are the so-called next to new minimal standard model type-II and -III. They can achieve gauge coupling unification as well as suitable dark matter abundance, small neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the universe, inflation, and dark energy. The gauge coupling unification can be realized by introducing two or three extra new fields, and they could explain charge quantization. We also show that there are regions in which the vacuum stability, coupling perturbativity, and correct dark matter abundance can be realized with current experimental data at the same time.

On the equivalence of Lambda(t) and gravitationally induced particle production cosmologies	10.1016/j.physletb.2013.12.027	The correspondence between cosmological models powered by a decaying vacuum energy density and gravitationally induced particle production is investigated. Although being physically different in the physics behind them we show that both classes of cosmologies under certain conditions can exhibit the same dynamic and thermodynamic behavior. Our method is applied to obtain three specific models that may be described either as A(t)CDM or gravitationally induced particle creation. In the point of view of particle production models, such cosmologies can be interpreted as a kind of one-component unification of the dark sector. By using current type la supernovae data, recent estimates of the cosmic microwave background shift parameter and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements we also perform a statistical analysis to test the observational viability within the two equivalent classes of models and we obtain the best-fit of the free parameters. By adopting the Akaike information criterion we also determine the rank of the models considered here. Finally, the particle production cosmologies (and the associated decaying A(t)-models) are modeled in the framework of field theory by a phenomenological scalar field model. (C) 2013 The Authors.

A note on dark matter and dark energy	10.1088/0264-9381/31/1/012001	Since the geometry of our universe seems to depend very little on baryonic matter, we consider a variational principle involving only dark matter and dark energy which in addition make them depend on each other. There are no adjustable parameters or scalar fields with appropriate equations of state. No quintessence. For a pressure-less, 3-flat FRW model, the cosmological `constant' is now a function of time, positive by definition and always small. Its time derivative or rather its associated parameter w is always negative and close to -1. The most interesting point is that the age of the universe and w itself are correlated. Moreover, this rather unsophisticated model provides a very limited range for both these quantities and results are in surprising agreement with observed values. The problem of vacuum energy remains what it was; the problem of coincidence is significantly less annoying.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY

In the soft band (0.5-2 keV), it will be about 30 times more sensitive than ROSAT, while in the hard band (2-8 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of the sky. The design driving science is the detection of large samples of galaxy clusters to redshifts z > 1 in order to study the large scale structure in the universe and test cosmological models including Dark Energy. In addition, eROSITA is expected to yield a sample of a few million AGN, including obscured objects, revolutionizing our view of the evolution of supermassive black holes. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including X-ray binaries, active stars and diffuse emission within the Galaxy. eROSITA is currently (June 2014) in its flight model and calibration phase. All seven flight mirror modules (+ 1 spare) have been delivered and measured in X-rays. The first camera including the complete electronics has been extensively tested (vacuum + X-rays).

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SPHERICAL COLLAPSE MODEL AND DARK ENERGY COSMOLOGIES		In the present paper, we study how the effects of deviations from spherical symmetry of a system, produced by angular momentum, and shear stress, influence typical parameters of the spherical collapse model, like the linear density threshold for collapse of the non-relativistic component (S) and its virial overdensity (Delta(V)). The study is performed in the framework of the Einstein-de Sitter and ACDM models, and assuming that the vacuum component is not clustering within the homogeneous non-spherical overdensities. We start from the standard spherical top hat model (SCM) which does not take account the non-spherical effects, and we add to this model the shear term and angular momentum term, which are finally expressed in terms of the density contrast, delta. We find that the non-spherical terms change the non-linear evolution of the system and that the collapse stops ``naturally{''} at the virial radius, differently from the standard spherical collapse model. Moreover, shear and rotation gives rise to higher values of the linear overdensity parameter and different values of Delta(V) with respect to the standard spherical collapse model.	BALTIC ASTRONOMY
Quantum Haplodynamics, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy	10.1155/2014/361587	In quantum haplodynamics (QHD) the weak bosons, quarks, and leptons are bound states of fundamental constituents, denoted as haplons. The confinement scale of the associated gauge group SU(2)(h) is of the order of Lambda(h) approximate to 0.3 TeV. One scalar state has zero haplon number and is the resonance observed at the LHC. In addition, there exist new bound states of haplons with no counterpart in the SM, having a mass of the order of 0.5 TeV up to a few TeV. In particular, a neutral scalar state with haplon number 4 is stable and can provide the dark matter in the universe. The QHD, QCD, and QED couplings can unify at the Planck scale. If this scale changes slowly with cosmic time, all of the fundamental couplings, the masses of the nucleons and of the DM particles, including the cosmological term (or vacuum energy density), will evolve with time. This could explain the dark energy of the universe.	ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Performance of the Dark Energy Camera Liquid Nitrogen Cooling System	10.1063/1.4860878	The Dark Energy Camera, the Imager and its cooling system was installed onto the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile in September 2012. The imager cooling system is a LN2 two-phase closed loop cryogenic cooling system. The cryogenic circulation processing is located off the telescope. Liquid nitrogen vacuum jacketed transfer lines are run up the outside of the telescope truss tubes to the imager inside the prime focus cage. The design of the cooling system along with commissioning experiences and initial cooling system performance is described. The LN2 cooling system with the DES imager was initially operated at Fermilab for testing, then shipped and tested in the Blanco Coude room. Now the imager is operating inside the prime focus cage. It is shown that the cooling performance sufficiently cools the imager in a closed loop mode, which can operate for extended time periods without maintenance or LN2 fills.

Pre-Big Bang, fundamental Physics and noncyclic cosmologies Possible alternatives to standard concepts and laws	10.1051/epjconf/20147000035	Detailed analyses of WMAP and Planck data can have significant implications for noncyclic pre-Big Bang approaches incorporating a new fundamental scale beyond the Planck scale and, potentially, new ultimate constituents of matter with unconventional basic properties as compared to standard particles. Cosmic-ray experiments at the highest energies can also yield relevant information. Hopefully, future studies will be able to deal with alternatives: i) to standard physics for the structure of the physical vacuum, the nature of space-time, the validity of quantum field theory and conventional symmetries, the interpretation of string-like theories...; ii) to standard cosmology concerning the origin and evolution of our Universe, unconventional solutions to the cosmological constant problem, the validity of inflationary scenarios, the need for dark matter and dark energy... Lorentz-like symmetries for the properties of matter can then be naturally stable space-time configurations resulting from more general primordial scenarios that incorporate physics beyond the Planck scale and describe the formation and evolution of the physical vacuum. A possible answer to the question of the origin of half-integer spins can be provided by a primordial spinorial space-time with two complex coordinates instead of the conventional four real ones, leading to a really new cosmology. We discuss basic questions and phenomenological topics concerning noncyclic pre-Big Bang cosmologies and potentially related physics.	1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEW FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS

Inhomogeneous and Interacting Vacuum Energy	10.1007/978-3-319-02063-1\_13	Vacuum energy is a simple model for dark energy driving an accelerated expansion of the universe. If the vacuum energy is inhomogeneous in spacetime then it must be interacting. We present the general equations for a spacetime-dependent vacuum energy in cosmology, including inhomogeneous perturbations. We show how any dark energy cosmology can be described by an interacting vacuum+matter. Different models for the interaction can lead to different behaviour (e.g., sound speed for dark energy perturbations) and hence could be distinguished by cosmological observations. As an example we present the cosmic microwave microwave background anisotropies and the matter power spectrum for two different versions of a generalised Chaplygin gas cosmology.

Vacuum energy and cosmological evolution	10.1063/1.4891113	An expanding universe is not expected to have a static vacuum energy density. The so-called cosmological constant. should be an approximation, certainly a good one for a fraction of a Hubble time, but it is most likely a temporary description of a true dynamical vacuum energy variable that is evolving from the inflationary epoch to the present day. We can compare the evolving vacuum energy with a Casimir device where the parallel plates slowly move apart ({''}expand{''}). The total vacuum energy density cannot be measured, only the effect associated to the presence of the plates, and then also their increasing separation with time. In the universe there is a nonvanishing spacetime curvature R as compared to Minkowskian spacetime that is changing with the expansion. The vacuum energy density must change accordingly, and we naturally expect delta Lambda similar to R similar to H-2. A class of dynamical vacuum models that trace such rate of change can be constructed. They are compatible with the current cosmological data, and conveniently extended can account for the complete cosmic evolution from the inflationary epoch till the present days. These models are very close to the Lambda CDM model for the late universe, but very different from it at the early times. Traces of the inherent vacuum dynamics could be detectable in our recent past.	"II RUSSIAN-SPANISH CONGRESS ON PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS AT ALL

Ya B Zeldovich's ideas and modern Brans-Dicke cosmology	10.3367/UFNr.0184.201404c.0379	We compare Ya B Zeldovich's ideas about Brans Dicke theory and Mach's principles, contained in now-classical books, with modern results in this field. Our recent results on the Brans Dicke cosmology with the cosmological term are presented. The Friedmann-Brans-Dicke equations are written for the flat Universe. The initial conditions for the model are provided by the presently observed Hubble constant, its first time derivative (the deceleration parameter), and matter density. The cosmological scenario with the scale factor not vanishing in the past, corresponding to the absence of the cosmological singularity, is analytically calculated. Instead of the singularity, the scale factor experiences a `bounce' and demonstrates regular behavior at all times. Some ideas related to Mach's principle are also discussed.	PHYSICS-USPEKHI
Cosmology: from Pomeranchuk to the present day	10.3367/UFNe.0184.201402k.0211	A review of half a century of cosmology is presented for an intended audience of elementary particle physicists. The review is based on a half-hour seminar talk (at the Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics, ITEP) and is therefore brief and superficial. The introductory historical section is mostly devoted to the fundamental work done in, but not always known outside, Russia (USSR). Foundational works and astronomical observations instrumental in shaping the field are discussed, as are inflation, baryosynthesis, dark matter and dark energy, vacuum energy, large-scale gravity modifications, and microwave background angular fluctuations. The presentation is admittedly not entirely objective but rather is given from the Russian (ITEP) perspective and is influenced by the author's personal views and biases.	PHYSICS-USPEKHI
Gravitational collapse and the vacuum energy	10.1088/1742-6596/496/1/012021	To explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, models with interacting dark components (dark energy and dark matter) have been considered recently in the literature. Generally, the dark energy component is physically interpreted as the vacuum energy of the all fields that fill the universe. As the other side of the same coin, the influence of the vacuum energy on the gravitational collapse is of great interest. We study such collapse adopting different parameterizations for the evolution of the vacuum energy. We discuss the homogeneous collapsing star fluid, that interacts with a vacuum energy component, using the stiff matter case as example. We conclude this work with a discussion of the Cahill-McVittie mass for the collapsed object.	"2ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE MODERN PHYSICS OF COMPACT STARS AND

Exact Axially Symmetric Solution in f(T) Gravity TheoryO	10.1155/2014/857936	A general tetrad field with sixteen unknown functions is applied to the field equations of f(T) gravity theory. An analytic vacuum solution is derived with two constants of integration and an angle Phi that depends on the angle coordinate phi and radial coordinate r. The tetrad field of this solution is axially symmetric and the scalar torsion vanishes. We calculate the associated metric of the derived solution and show that it represents Kerr spacetime. Finally, we show that the derived solution can be described by two local Lorentz transformations in addition to a tetrad field that is the square root of the Kerr metric. One of these local Lorentz transformations is a special case of Euler's angles and the other represents a boost when the rotation parameter vanishes.	ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Generating a cosmological constant with gravitational waves	10.1007/s10714-013-1635-5	A technique is given to derive the well known Bell-Szekeres solution of the Einstein-Maxwell vacuum field equations describing the space-time and the Maxwell field following the head-on collision of two homogeneous, plane, electromagnetic shock waves. The analogue of this technique is then utilized to construct the space-time model of the gravitational field following the head-on collision of two homogeneous, plane, gravitational shock waves. The latter collision, which is followed by a pair of impulsive gravitational waves and a pair of light like shells traveling away from each other, provides a mechanism for generating a cosmological constant which may be important in the theoretical description of dark energy.

The trace-free Einstein equations and inflation	10.1007/s10714-013-1619-5	The trace-free version of the Einstein Gravitational equations, essentially equivalent to unimodular gravity, can solve the troubling issue of the huge discrepancy between quantum field theory estimates of the vacuum energy density and the astronomically observed value of the cosmological constant. However it has been suggested that this proposal cannot work because it prevents the inflaton potential energy from driving inflation. It is shown here that that concern is unjustified: inflation proceeds as usual if we adopt the trace free gravitational equations.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Deviation from the standard uncertainty principle and the dark energy problem	10.1007/s10714-013-1632-8	Quantum fluctuations of a real massless scalar field are studied in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The dynamical finite vacuum energy is found in spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime which can be identified as dark energy to explain late time cosmic speed-up. The results show that a tiny deviation from the standard uncertainty principle is necessary on cosmological ground. By using the observational data we have constraint the GUP parameter even more stronger than ever.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Cosmological dynamics in f(R) gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.124036	In this paper, we study the cosmological viability conditions, the phase-space dynamics, and the cosmological evolution of f(R) gravity. In contrast to most previous works in the literature, which analyzed the background dynamics of f(R) gravity by means of a dynamical system, we proceed by focusing on the equivalent scalar field description of the theory, which we believe is a more intuitive way of treating the problem. In order to study how the physical solutions evolve in f(R) cosmology, we explore the cosmological dynamics of a range of f(R) models, including models that yield a large hierarchy of scales and are singularity free. We present generic features of the phase-space dynamics in f(R) cosmology. We study the global structure of the phase space in f(R) gravity by compactifying the infinite phase space into a finite space via the Poincare transformation. On the expansion branch of the phase space, the constraint surface has a repeller and a de Sitter attractor, while on the contraction branch, the constraint surface has an attractor and a de Sitter repeller. Generally, the phase currents originate from the repeller and terminate at the corresponding attractor in each space. The trajectories between the repeller and the attractor in the presence of matter density are different from those in the vacuum case. The phase analysis techniques developed in this paper are very general, and can be applied to other similar dynamical systems.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Topology and Dark Energy: Testing Gravity in Voids	10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.241103	Modified gravity has garnered interest as a backstop against dark matter and dark energy (DE). As one possible modification, the graviton can become massive, which introduces a new scalar field-here with a Galileon-type symmetry. The field can lead to a nontrivial equation of state of DE which is density and scale dependent. Tension between type Ia supernovae and Planck could be reduced. In voids, the scalar field dramatically alters the equation of state of DE, induces a soon-observable gravitational slip between the two metric potentials, and develops a topological defect (domain wall) due to a nontrivial vacuum structure for the field.

Dark Energy from Discrete Spacetime	10.1371/journal.pone.0080826	Dark energy accounts for most of the matter-energy content of our universe, yet current theories of its origin rely on radical physical assumptions such as the holographic principle or controversial anthropic arguments. We give a better motivated explanation for dark energy, claiming that it arises from a small negative scalar-curvature present even in empty spacetime. The vacuum has this curvature because spacetime is fundamentally discrete and there are more ways for a discrete geometry to have negative curvature than positive. We explicitly compute this effect using a variant of the well known dynamical-triangulations (DT) model for quantum gravity. Our model predicts a time-varying non-zero cosmological constant with a current value, in natural units, in agreement with observation. This calculation is made possible by a novel characterization of the possible DT action values combined with numerical evidence concerning their degeneracies.	PLOS ONE
Anisotropic universe with anisotropic sources	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/12/003	We analyze the state space of a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic sources. Here we consider an extended state space which includes null geodesics in this background. The evolution equations for all the state observables are derived. Dynamical systems approach is used to study the evolution of these equations. The asymptotic stable fixed points for all the evolution equations are found. We also check our analytic results with numerical analysis of these dynamical equations. The evolution of the state observables are studied both in cosmic time and using a dimensionless time variable. Then we repeat the same analysis with a more realistic scenario, adding the isotropic (dust like dark) matter and a cosmological constant (dark energy) to our anisotropic sources, to study their co-evolution. The universe now approaches a de Sitter space asymptotically dominated by the cosmological constant. The cosmic microwave background anisotropy maps due to shear are also generated in this scenario, assuming that the universe contains anisotropic matter along with the usual (dark) matter and vacuum (dark) energy since decoupling. We find that they contribute dominantly to the CMB quadrupole. We also constrain the current level of anisotropy and also search for any cosmic preferred axis present in the data. We use the Union 2 Supernovae data to this extent. An anisotropy axis close to the mirror symmetry axis seen in the cosmic microwave background data from Planck probe is found.

COSMOGRAPHY OF INTERACTING GENERALIZED QCD GHOST DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0218271813500843	Exploring the accelerated expansion of the universe, we investigate the generalized ghost dark energy (GGDE) model from the statefinder diagnostic analysis in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. First, we calculate the cosmological evolution and statefinder trajectories for noninteracting case and then extend this work by considering the interaction between dark matter and dark energy components. We show that in the noninteracting case the phantom line cannot be crossed and also the evolutionary trajectories of model in s - r plane cannot be discriminated. It has been shown that the present location of model in s - r plane would be close to observational value for negative values of the model parameter. In the presence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy, the phantom regime is achieved, the accelerated phase of expansion occurs sooner compared with the noninteracting case. The GGDE model is also discussed from the viewpoint of perturbation theory by calculating the adiabatic sound speed of the model. Finally, unlike the noninteracting case, the evolutionary trajectories in s - r plane can be discriminated in the interacting model. Like the noninteracting model, in the interacting case the present location of GGDE model is closer to observational value for negative values of the model parameter.

ON THE PROBLEM OF VACUUM ENERGY IN FLRW UNIVERSES AND DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0217732313501666	We present a (hopefully) novel calculation of the vacuum energy in expanding FLRW spacetimes based on the renormalization of quantum field theory in nonzero backgrounds. We compute the renormalized effective action up to the two-point function and then apply the formalism to the cosmological backgrounds of interest. As an example we calculate for quasi de Sitter spacetimes the leading correction to the vacuum energy given by the tadpole diagram and show that it behaves as similar to H-0(2)Lambda(P) where H-0 is the Hubble constant and Lambda(P) is the Planck constant. This is of the same order of magnitude as the observed dark energy density in the universe.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Noether symmetries and analytical solutions in f(T) cosmology: A complete study	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.103526	We investigate the main features of the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models in the f(T) modified gravity regime. In particular, a general approach to find out exact cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity is discussed. Instead of taking into account phenomenological models, we consider as a selection criterion, the existence of Noether symmetries in the cosmological f(T) pointlike Lagrangian. We find that only the f(T) = f(0)T(n) model admits extra Noether symmetries. The existence of extra Noether integrals can be used in order to simplify the system of differential equations (equations of motion) as well as to determine the integrability of the f(T) = f(0)T(n) cosmological model. Within this context, we can solve the problem analytically and thus we provide the evolution of the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the Universe, the Hubble expansion rate, the deceleration parameter, and the linear matter perturbations. We show that the f(T) = f(0)T(n) cosmological model suffers from two basic problems. The first problem is related to the fact that the deceleration parameter is constant which means that it never changes sign, and therefore the Universe always accelerates or always decelerates depending on the value of n. Second, we find that the clustering growth rate remains always equal to unity implying that the recent growth data disfavor the f(T) = f(0)T(n) gravity. Finally, we prove that the f(T) = f(0)T(n) gravity can be cosmologically equivalent with the f(R) = R-n gravity model and the time varying vacuum model Lambda(H) = 3 gamma H-2 (for n(-1) = 1 - gamma) because the above cosmological scenarios share exactly the same Hubble expansion, despite the fact that the three models have a different geometrical origin. Finally, some important differences with power-law f(R) gravity are pointed out.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER IN A SUPERFLUID UNIVERSE	10.1142/S0217751X13300494	The vacuum is filled with complex scalar fields, such as the Higgs field. These fields serve as order parameters for superfluidity (quantum phase coherence over macroscopic distances), making the entire universe a superfluid. We review a mathematical model consisting of two aspects: (a) emergence of the superfluid during the big bang; (b) observable manifestations of superfluidity in the present universe. The creation aspect requires a self-interacting scalar field that is asymptotically free, i.e. the interaction must grow from zero during the big bang, and this singles out the Halpern-Huang potential, which has exponential behavior for large fields. It leads to an equivalent cosmological constant that decays like a power law, and this gives dark energy without ``fine-tuning.{''} Quantum turbulence (chaotic vorticity) in the early universe was able to create all the matter in the universe, fulfilling the inflation scenario. In the present universe, the superfluid can be phenomenologically described by a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation. It predicts halos around galaxies with higher superfluid density, which is perceived as dark matter through gravitational lensing. In short, dark energy is the energy density of the cosmic superfluid, and dark matter arises from local fluctuations of the superfluid density.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
A model for dark energy decay	10.1016/j.physletb.2013.08.011	We discuss a model of nonperturbative decay of dark energy. We suggest the possibility that this model can provide a mechanism from the field theory to realize the energy transfer from dark energy into dark matter, which is the requirement to alleviate the coincidence problem. The advantage of the model is the fact that it accommodates a mean life compatible with the age of the universe. We also argue that supersymmetry is a natural set up, though not essential.

The plane symmetric vacuum solutions of modified field equations in metric f(R) gravity	10.1007/s10509-013-1565-4	The f(R) theories of gravity have been interested in recent years. A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the study of modified field equations with the assumption of constant Ricci scalar which may be zero or nonzero. In this paper, the exact vacuum solutions of plane symmetric spacetime are analyzed in f(R) theory of gravity. The modified field equations are studied not only for R=constant but also for general case R not equal constant. In particular, we show that the NovotnA1/2-HorskA1/2 and anti-de Sitter spacetimes are the exact solutions of the field equations with the non-zero constant Ricci scalar. Finally, the family of solutions with R not equal constant is obtained explicitly which includes the NovotnA1/2-HorskA1/2, Kottler-Whittaker, Taub and conformally flat spacetimes.

Viscous fluid cosmology with time dependent q and Lambda-term in Bianchi type-I space-time and late time acceleration	10.1007/s12648-013-0342-0	Exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are obtained in a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time in presence of a dissipative fluid with constant and time dependent cosmological term . Einstein's field equations are solved by considering a time dependent deceleration parameter, which affords a late time acceleration in the universe. The cosmological constant is found to be a decreasing function of time and it approaches a small positive value at present epoch, which is corroborated by consequences from recent supernovae I (a) observations. To get the deterministic solution a barotropic equation of state together with shear viscosity, proportional to expansion scalar, is also assumed. It is observed that initial nature of singularity is not changed due to presence of viscous fluid. The basic equation of thermodynamics is deduced and thermodynamic aspects of models are discussed. Physical and geometric properties of cosmological models are also discussed.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Holographic DBI-Essence Dark Energy via Power-Law Solution of the Scale Factor	10.1007/s10773-013-1705-1	The present work reports a Holographic reconstruction of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)-essence Dark Energy (DE) in a flat FRW universe. The scale factor a(t) is chosen in power law form. We have reconstructed the scalar field and potential and subsequently the equation of state (EoS) parameter omega of the DBI-essence DE. The corresponding plots show increasing scalar field, decaying tension and decaying potential. The reconstructed EoS parameter stays below -1, showing a phantom-like behavior. The stability of the reconstructed DBI-essence DE is investigated through squared speed of sound : its negative sign reveals that the holographically reconstructed DBI-essence is classically unstable.

Dark energy and fundamental physics	10.1007/s00159-013-0067-2	The acceleration of the expansion of the Universe which has been identified in recent years has deep connections with some of the most central issues in fundamental physics. At present, the most plausible explanation is some form of vacuum energy. The puzzle of vacuum energy is a central question which lies at the interface between quantum theory and general relativity. Solving it will presumably require to construct a quantum theory of gravity and a correspondingly consistent picture of spacetime. To account for the acceleration of the expansion, one may also think of more dynamical forms of energy, what is known as dark energy, or modifications of gravity. In what follows, we review the vacuum energy problem as well as the basic models for dark energy or modification of gravity. We emphasize the conceptual aspects rather than the techniques involved. We also discuss the difficulties encountered in each approach. This review is intended for astrophysicists or physicists not specialized in particle physics, who are interested in apprehending the issues at stake in fundamental physics.

Entropic cosmology for a generalized black-hole entropy	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.083534	An entropic-force scenario, i.e., entropic cosmology, assumes that the horizon of the Universe has an entropy and a temperature. In the present paper, in order to examine entropic cosmology, we derive entropic-force terms not only from the Bekenstein entropy but also from a generalized black-hole entropy proposed by Tsallis and Cirto [Eur. Phys. J. C 73, 2487 (2013)]. Unlike the Bekenstein entropy, which is proportional to area, the generalized entropy is proportional to volume because of appropriate nonadditive generalizations. The entropic-force term derived from the generalized entropy is found to behave as if it were an extra driving term for bulk viscous cosmology, in which a bulk viscosity of cosmological fluids is assumed. Using an effective description similar to bulk viscous cosmology, we formulate the modified Friedmann, acceleration, and continuity equations for entropic cosmology. Based on this formulation, we propose two entropic-force models derived from the Bekenstein and generalized entropies. In order to examine the properties of the two models, we consider a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat universe, focusing on a single-fluid-dominated universe. The two entropic-force models agree well with the observed supernova data. Interestingly, the entropic-force model derived from the generalized entropy predicts a decelerating and accelerating universe, as for a fine-tuned standard Lambda CDM (lambda cold dark matter) model, whereas the entropic-force model derived from the Bekenstein entropy predicts a uniformly accelerating universe.

Probing a cosmological model with a Lambda = Lambda(0)+3 beta H-2 decaying vacuum	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.083530	In this work we study the evolution of matter-density perturbations for an arbitrary Lambda(t) model and specialize our analysis to the particular phenomenological law Lambda = Lambda(0) + 3 beta H-2. We study the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate in this particular dark energy scenario and, by constraining the beta parameter using both the age of the Universe and the cosmic star formation rate curve, we show that it leads to a reasonable physical model for beta less than or similar to 0.1.

Interacting dark sector with variable vacuum energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.087301	We examine a cosmological scenario where dark matter is coupled to a variable vacuum energy while baryons and photons are two decoupled components for a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We apply the chi 2 method to the updated observational Hubble data for constraining the cosmological parameters and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation era. We show that our model fulfills the severe bound of Omega(x)(z similar or equal to 1100) < 0.009 at the 2 sigma level, so it is consistent with the recent analysis that includes cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from the Planck survey, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope along with the future constraints achievable by the Euclid and CMBPol experiments, and fulfills the stringent bound Omega(x)(z similar or equal to 1010) < 0.04 at the 2 sigma level in the big-bang nucleosynthesis epoch.

INFLATIONARY DARK ENERGY FROM A CONDENSATE OF SPINORS IN A 5D VACUUM	10.1142/S0218271813420285	What is the physical origin of dark energy? Could this energy be originated by other fields than the inflaton? In this paper, we explore the possibility that the expansion of the universe can be driven by a condensate of spinors. These spinors are free of interactions on five-dimensional (5D) relativistic vacuum in an extended de Sitter spacetime. The extra coordinate is considered as noncompact. After making a static foliation on the extra coordinate, we obtain an effective four-dimensional (4D) (inflationary) de Sitter expansion which describes an inflationary universe. In view of our results, we conclude that the condensate of spinors here studied could be an interesting candidate to explain the presence of dark energy in the early universe.

FROM INFLATION TO DARK ENERGY THROUGH A DYNAMICAL.: AN ATTEMPT AT ALLEVIATING FUNDAMENTAL COSMIC PUZZLES	10.1142/S021827181342008X	After decades of successful hot big-bang paradigm, cosmology still lacks a framework in which the early inflationary phase of the universe smoothly matches the radiation epoch and evolves to the present ``quasi{''} de Sitter spacetime. No less intriguing is that the current value of the effective vacuum energy density is vastly smaller than the value that triggered inflation. In this paper, we propose a new class of cosmologies capable of overcoming, or highly alleviating, some of these acute cosmic puzzles. Powered by a decaying vacuum energy density, the spacetime emerges from a pure nonsingular de Sitter vacuum stage, ``gracefully{''} exits from inflation to a radiation phase followed by dark matter and vacuum regimes, and, finally, evolves to a late-time de Sitter phase.

Clustering of quintessence on horizon scales and its imprint on HI intensity mapping	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/10/015	Quintessence can cluster only on horizon scales. What is the effect on the observed matter distribution? To answer this, we need a relativistic approach that goes beyond the standard Newtonian calculation and deals properly with large scales. Such an approach has recently been developed for the case when dark energy is vacuum energy, which does not cluster at all. We extend this relativistic analysis to deal with dynamical dark energy. Using three quintessence potentials as examples, we compute the angular power spectrum for the case of an HI intensity map survey. Compared to the concordance model with the same small-scale power at z = 0, quintessence boosts the angular power by up to similar to 15\% at high redshifts, while power in the two models converges at low redshifts. The difference is mainly due to the background evolution, driven mostly by the normalization of the power spectrum today. The dark energy perturbations make only a small contribution on the largest scales, and a negligible contribution on smaller scales. Ironically, the dark energy perturbations remove the false boost of large-scale power that arises if we impose the (unphysical) assumption that the dark energy is smooth.

CLIFFORD SPACE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD EQUATIONS AND DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0219887813500394	We continue with the study of Clifford-space (C-space) gravity and analyze further the C-space generalized gravitational field equations which are obtained from a variational principle based on the generalization of the Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action. One of the main features is that the C-space connection requires torsion in order to have consistency with the Clifford algebraic structure associated with the curved C-space basis generators. Hence no spin matter is required to induce torsion since it already exists in the vacuum. The field equations in C-spaces associated to a Clifford algebra in D dimensions are not equivalent to the ordinary gravitational equations with torsion in higher 2(D) dimensions. The most physically relevant conclusion, besides the presence of torsion in the vacuum, is the contribution of the higher grade metric components g(mu 1 mu 2 nu 1 nu 2) , g(mu 1 mu 2 mu 3 nu 1 nu 2 nu 3) , . . . of the C-space metric to dark energy/dark matter.

Various aspects of interacting modified holographic Ricci dark energy	10.1007/s12648-013-0328-y	The present paper reports various aspects of modified holographic Ricci dark energy interacting with pressureless dark matter in a flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe. The cosmological parameters, namely, Hubble parameter, equation of state parameter and deceleration parameter have been studied under this interaction. Statfinder diagnostics has also been studied, where attainment of CDM phase of the universe under this interaction has been observed. A study on fractional densities has prominently shown the transition from matter dominated to dark energy dominated universe.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Complete cosmic history with a dynamical Lambda = Lambda(H) term	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.063531	In the present mainstream cosmology, matter and space-time emerged from a singularity and evolved through four distinct periods: early inflation, radiation, dark matter, and late-time inflation (driven by dark energy). During the radiation and dark matter dominated stages, the universe is decelerating while the early and late-time inflations are accelerating stages. A possible connection between the accelerating periods remains unknown, and, even more intriguing, the best dark energy candidate powering the present accelerating stage (Lambda-vacuum) is plagued with the cosmological constant and coincidence puzzles. Here we propose an alternative solution for such problems based on a large class of time-dependent vacuum energy density models in the form of power series of the Hubble rate, Lambda = Lambda(H). The proposed class of Lambda(H)-decaying vacuum model provides: (i) a new mechanism for inflation (different from the usual inflaton models), (ii) a natural mechanism for a graceful exit, which is universal for the whole class of models; (iii) the currently accelerated expansion of the universe, (iv) a mild dynamical dark energy at present; and (v) a final de Sitter stage. Remarkably, the late-time cosmic expansion history of our class of models is very close to the concordance Lambda CDM model, but above all it furnishes the necessary smooth link between the initial and final de Sitter stages through the radiation- and matter-dominated epochs.

Exact solutions in massive gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/30/18/184002	Massive gravity is a good theoretical framework to study the modifications of General Relativity. The theory offers a concrete set-up to study models of dark energy, since it admits cosmological self-accelerating solutions in the vacuum, in which the size of the acceleration depends on the graviton mass. Moreover, nonlinear gravitational self-interactions, in the proximity of a matter source, manage to mimic the predictions of linearized General Relativity; hence, agreeing with solar-system precision measurements. In this paper, we review our work in the subject, classifying, on one hand, static solutions, and on the other hand, self-accelerating backgrounds. For the static solutions, we exhibit black hole configurations, together with other solutions that recover General Relativity near a source via the Vainshtein mechanism. For the self-accelerating solutions, we describe a wide class of cosmological backgrounds, including an analysis of their stability.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
THE SIGNATURES OF NEW PHYSICS, ASTROPHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY?	10.1142/S0217732313501241	The first three years of the LHC experiments at CERN have ended with ``the nightmare scenario{''}: all tests, on the Standard Model of Particles so well that theorists must search for new physics without any experimental guidance. The supersymmetric theories, a privileged candidate for new physics, are nearly excluded. As a potential escape from the crisis, we propose thinking about a series of astonishing relations suggesting fundamental interconnections between the quantum world and the large scale Universe. It seems reasonable that, for instance, the equation relating a quark-antiquark pair with the fundamental physical constants and cosmological parameters must be a sign of new physics. One of the intriguing possibilities is interpreting our relations as a signature of the quantum vacuum containing the virtual gravitational dipoles.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Energy Distribution for a Power Model of the Plane Symmetric Spacetime in f(R) Gravity		The study of the energy localization in f(R) theories of gravity has attracted much interest in recent years. In this paper, the vacuum solutions of the modified field equations for a power model of plane symmetric metric are studied in metric f(R) gravity with the assumption of constant Ricci scalar. Next, we determine the energy-momentum complexes in f(R) theories of gravity for this spacetime for some important models. We also show that these models satisfy the stability and constant curvature conditions.	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Zero cosmological constant and nonzero dark energy from the holographic principle	10.3938/jkps.63.1088	The first law of thermodynamics and the holographic principle applied to an arbitrary large cosmic causal horizon are shown to naturally demand a zero cosmological constant and a non-zero dynamical dark energy in the form of the holographic dark energy. A semiclassical analysis shows that the holographic dark energy has a parameter d = 1 and an equation of state comparable to current observational data if the entropy of the horizon saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking bound. This result indicates that quantum field theory should be modified on a large scale to explain the dark energy. The relations among the dark energy, the quantum vacuum energy and the entropic gravity are also discussed.	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY
Gravity from quantum information	10.3938/jkps.63.1094	We suggest that the Einstein equation can be derived from Landauer's principle applied to an information erasing process at a local Rindler horizon and Jacobson's idea linking the Einstein equation with thermodynamics. When matter crosses the horizon, information on the matter disappears, and the horizon entanglement entropy increases to compensate for the entropy reduction. The Einstein equation describes an information-energy relation during this process, which implies that entropic gravity is related to the quantum entanglement of the vacuum and has a quantuminformation theoretic origin.

C-field cosmological model for barotropic fluid distribution with bulk viscosity and decaying vacuum energy (Lambda) in FRW space-time	10.1139/cjp-2013-0167	A solution of Einstein's field equations that admits barotropic fluid distribution and a negative-energy massless scalar creation field as a source in the presence of bulk viscosity and time-dependent vacuum energy density (Lambda) is investigated. It is shown that a cosmological model based on this solution satisfies observational tests and is thus a viable alternative to the standard Big Bang model. The present model is free from real singularity and particle horizon. The creation field increases with time, which matches the result as obtained by Hoyle and Narlikar (Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 282, 178 (1964)). The vacuum energy density, Lambda similar to t(-2), matches the result as obtained by Bertolami (Nuovocim. B, 93, 36 (1986)). The spatial volume increases exponentially with time. Thus the model has an inflationary scenario. The deceleration parameter q < 0 indicating that the model represents accelerating expansion of the universe. The presence of the creation field prevents matter density from vanishing and it remains constant for large t. We also observe that bulk viscosity slows down the rate of decrease of volume expansion.

Analytic Charged Spherically Symmetric Solution in f(T) Gravity	10.7566/JPSJ.82.094006	The framework of f(T) gravity theory is analyzed to obtain a spherically symmetric non-vacuum solution that has two constants of integration. The constants of integration are analyzed and it is shown that one is related to the gravitational mass while the other is related to the electric charge. The scalar torsion of this solution depends on the electric charge. The energy-momentum tensor that gives the Reissner Nordstrom spacetime is derived for specific form of f(T).

QCD ghost dark energy cannot (even roughly) explain the main features of the accepted cosmological paradigm	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.043008	We explore the whole phase space of the so-called Veneziano/QCD ghost dark energy models where the dynamics of the inner trapping horizon is ignored and also the more realistic models where the time dependence of the horizon is taken into consideration. We pay special attention to the choice of phase space variables leading to bounded and compact phase space so that no critical point of physical interest is missing. It is demonstrated that ghost dark energy is not a suitable candidate to explain the presently accepted cosmological paradigm, since no critical point associated with matter dominance is found in the physical phase space of the model. A transient stage of matter dominance-responsible for the observed amount of cosmic structure-is an essential ingredient of the accepted cosmological paradigm. The above drawback is in addition to the well-known problem with classical instability against small perturbations of the background density originated from negativity of the sound speed squared.

Nonlocal theory of massive gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.044033	We construct a fully covariant theory of massive gravity which does not require the introduction of an external reference metric, and overcomes the usual problems of massive gravity theories (fatal ghosts instabilities, acausality and/or van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity). The equations of motion of the theory are nonlocal but respect causality. The starting point is the quadratic action proposed in the context of the degravitation idea. We show that it is possible to extend it to a fully nonlinear covariant theory. This theory describes the 5 degrees of freedom of a massive graviton plus a scalar ghost. However, contrary to generic nonlinear extensions of Fierz-Pauli massive gravity, the ghost has the same mass m as the massive graviton, independently of the background, and smoothly goes into a nonradiative degree of freedom for m -> 0. As a consequence, for m similar to H-0 the vacuum instability induced by the ghost is irrelevant even over cosmological time scales. We finally show that an extension of the model degravitates a vacuum energy density of order M-Pl(4) down to a value of order M-Pl(2) m(2), which for m = O(H-0) is of order of the observed value of the vacuum energy density.

Reconstruction of Scalar Field Dark Energy Models in Kaluza-Klein Universe		This paper is devoted to study the modified holographic dark energy model by taking its different aspects in the flat Kaluza-Klein universe. We construct the equation of state parameter which evolutes the universe from quintessence region towards the vacuum. It is found that the modified holographic model exhibits instability against small perturbations in the early epoch of the universe but becomes stable in the later times. We also develop its correspondence with some scalar field dark energy models. It is interesting to mention here that all the results are consistent with the present observations.

Higgs Seesaw Mechanism as a Source for Dark Energy	10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.061802	Motivated by the seesaw mechanism for neutrinos which naturally generates small neutrino masses, we explore how a small grand-unified-theory-scale mixing between the standard model Higgs boson and an otherwise massless hidden sector scalar can naturally generate a small mass and vacuum expectation value for the new scalar which produces a false vacuum energy density contribution comparable to that of the observed dark energy dominating the current expansion of the Universe. This provides a simple and natural mechanism for producing the correct scale for dark energy, even if it does not address the long-standing question of why much larger dark energy contributions are not produced from the visible sector. The new scalar produces no discernible signatures in existing terrestrial experiments so that one may have to rely on other cosmological tests of this idea.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
Exact tunneling solutions in Minkowski spacetime and a candidate for dark energy	10.1007/JHEP08(2013)075	We study exact tunneling solution, in scalar field theory for potential barriers composed of linear or quadratic patches. We analytically continue our solutions to imaginary Euclidean radius in order to study the profile of the scalar field inside the growing bubble. We find that generally there is a non-trivial profile of the scalar field, generating a stress-energy tensor, that depending on the form of the potential, can be a candidate for dark energy.

Interacting dark energy: a generalized scenario and observational constraints	10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2538-z	A generalized scenario, which is used to characterize the attenuated dilution of cold dark matter deviating from the standard case, is proposed for the interaction of cosmological dark sectors. This generalized framework cannot only fully recover the three frequently studied phenomenological parameterizations in the limit of the characteristic parameter alpha -> -1, 0 and +1, but also admits a much wider range of cosmological solutions for other values of a. Moreover, some cosmological consequences are examined by placing constraints on this generalized interacting model with current observational data. We find that, for a in the extended range of [-1.0, 1.0], the case in which the energy flow transfers from dark matter to dark energy is slightly favored by observations.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Stability of the self-accelerating universe in massive gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/08/044	We study linear perturbations around time dependent spherically symmetric solutions in the Lambda(3) massive gravity theory, which self-accelerate in the vacuum. We find that the dynamics of the scalar perturbations depend on the choice of the fiducial metric for the background solutions. For particular choice of fiducial metric there is a symmetry enhancement, leaving no propagating scalar degrees of freedom at linear order in perturbations. In contrast, any other choice propagates a single scalar mode. We find that the Hamiltonian of this scalar mode is unbounded from below for all self-accelerating solutions, signalling an instability.

A Generalized Semi-Holographic Universe	10.1088/0256-307X/30/8/089801	We study the semi-holographic idea in the context of decaying dark components. The energy flow between dark energy and the compensating dark matter is thermodynamically generalized to involve a particle number variable dark component with non-zero chemical potential. It is found that, unlike the original semi-holographic model, no cosmological constant is needed for a dynamical evolution of the universe. A transient phantom phase appears while a non-trivial dark energy-dark matter scaling solution stays at a later time, which evades the big-rip and helps to resolve the coincidence problem. For reasonable parameters, the deceleration parameter is well consistent with current observations. The original semi-holographic model is extended and it also suggests that the concordance model may be reconstructed from the semi-holographic idea.	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
Generalized ghost dark energy in Brans-Dicke theory	10.1139/cjp-2012-0531	It was argued that the vacuum energy of the Veneziano ghost field of QCD, in a time-dependent background, can be written in the general form, H + O(H-2), where H is the Hubble parameter. Based on this, a phenomenological dark energy model whose energy density is of the form rho = alpha H + beta H-2 was recently proposed to explain the dark energy dominated universe. In this paper, we investigate this generalized ghost dark energy model in the setup of Brans-Dicke cosmology. We study the cosmological implications of this model. In particular, we obtain the equation of state, the deceleration parameters, and a differential equation governing the evolution of this dark energy model. It is shown that the equation of state parameter of the generalized ghost dark energy can cross the phantom line (w(D) = -1) in some range of the parameters spaces.	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Non-existence of Bianchi type-III bulk viscous string cosmological model in f(R,T) gravity	10.1007/s10509-013-1459-5	A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-III space-time is considered in the presence of bulk viscous fluid containing one dimensional cosmic strings in the frame work of f(R,T) gravity proposed by Harko et al. (Phys. Rev. D 84:024020, 2011). To get a determinate solution of the field equations of this theory, we have used (i) a barotropic equation of state for the pressure and density and (ii) the bulk viscous pressure is proportional to the energy density. It is interesting to observe that, in this case, Bianchi type-III bulk viscous string cosmological model does not exist and degenerates into vacuum model of general relativity.

Vacuum solution of a quadratic red-shift based correction in f(R) gravity	10.1007/s10509-013-1477-3	In the present paper, using action derivative with respect to Ricci scalar and its expansion relative to red-shift, to the second-order and consequently without needing dark energy, the history of cosmos expansion is reconstructed in vacuum. Then, employing supernova data, free parameters of the model which are the expansion coefficients, are calculated. It will be seen that if the free parameters of the model are zero, action of general relativity, which is a boundary mode of the gravity, is found. Also the cosmic age for this model in vacuum is calculated. Finally, it is attempted to reconstruct the reference action in terms of its Taylor expansion. Thus, it will be found that the reconstructed action and their actions definitely pass the Solar system tests.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Scalar and fermionic vacuum currents in de Sitter spacetime with compact dimensions	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.024028	Vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the current densities for charged scalar and Dirac spinor fields are investigated in (D + 1)-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. Along compact dimensions we impose quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary phases. In addition, the presence of a classical constant gauge field is assumed. The VEVs of the charge density and of the components for the current density along noncompact dimensions vanish. The gauge field leads to Aharonov-Bohm-like oscillations of the components along compact dimensions as functions of the magnetic flux. For small values of the comoving length of a compact dimension, compared with the dS curvature scale, the current density is related to the corresponding current in the Minkowski spacetime by a conformal relation. For large values of the comoving length and for a scalar field, depending on the mass of the field, two different regimes are realized with the monotonic and oscillatory damping of the current density. For a massive spinor field, the decay of the current density is always oscillatory. In supersymmetric models on the background of Minkowski spacetime with equal number of scalar and fermionic degrees of freedom and with the same phases in the periodicity conditions, the total current density vanishes due to the cancellation between the scalar and fermionic parts. The background gravitational field modifies the current densities for scalar and fermionic fields in different ways, and for massive fields there is no cancellation in the dS spacetime.

Probing Hawking and Unruh effects and quantum field theory in curved space by geometric invariants	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.024027	The presence of noncyclic geometric invariant is revealed in all the phenomena where particle generation from vacuum or vacuum condensates appear. Aharonov-Anandan invariants then can help to study such systems and can represent a new tool to be used in order to provide laboratory evidence of phenomena particulary hard to be detected, such as Hawking and Unruh effects and some features of quantum field theory in curved space simulated by some graphene morphologies. It is finally suggested that a very precise quantum thermometer can be built by exploiting geometric invariants properties.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Tumbling through a landscape: Evidence of instabilities in high-dimensional moduli spaces	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.026005	We argue that a generic instability afflicts vacua that arise in theories whose moduli space has large dimension. Specifically, by studying theories with multiple scalar fields we provide numerical evidence that for a generic local minimum of the potential the usual semiclassical bubble nucleation rate, Gamma = Ae(-B), increases rapidly as function of the number of fields in the theory. As a consequence, the fraction of vacua with tunneling rates low enough to maintain metastability appears to fall exponentially as a function of the moduli space dimension. We discuss possible implications for the landscape of string theory. Notably, if our results prove applicable to string theory, the landscape of metastable vacua may not contain sufficient diversity to offer a natural explanation of dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Possible compensation of the QCD vacuum contribution to the dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.023509	We suggest one of the possible ways to compensate the large negative quantum-topological QCD contribution to the vacuum energy density of the Universe by means of a positive constant contribution from a cosmological Yang-Mills field. An important role of the exact particular solution for the Yang-Mills field corresponding to the finite-time instantons is discussed. An interesting connection of the compensation mechanism to the color confinement in the framework of instanton models has been pointed out. Besides the Lambda(QCD) scale, this proposal relies on one dimensionless normalization constant which cannot be fixed by the perturbative QCD theory, and thus should be fine-tuned for the exact compensation to hold.

Dark energy from instantons	10.1134/S0202289313030067	We show that in imaginary time quantum metric fluctuations of empty space form a self-consistent de Sitter gravitational instanton that can be thought of as describing tunneling from ``nothing{''} into de Sitter space of real time (no cosmological constant or scalar fields are needed). For the first time, this mechanism is activated to give birth to a flat inflationary Universe. For the second time, it is turned on to complete the cosmological evolution after the energy density of matter drops below the threshold (the energy density of instantons). A cosmological expansion with dark energy takes over after the scale factor exceeds this threshold, which marks the birth of dark energy at a redshift 1 + z a parts per thousand 1.3 and provides a possible solution to the ``coincidence problem{''}. The number of gravitons which tunneled into the Universe must be of the order of 10(122) to create the observed value of the Hubble constant. This number has nothing to do with vacuum energy, which is a possible solution to the ``old cosmological constant problem{''}. The emptying Universe should possibly complete its evolution by tunneling back to ``nothing{''}. After that, the entire scenario is repeated, and it can happen endlessly.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
CONNECTING THE NONSINGULAR ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE, THE VACUUM STRUCTURE AND THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PROBLEM	10.1142/S0218271813300188	We consider a nonsingular origin for the universe starting from an Einstein static universe, the so-called ``emergent universe{''} scenario, in the framework of a theory which uses two volume elements root-gd(4)x and Phi d(4)x, where F is a metric independent density, used as an additional measure of integration. Also curvature, curvature square terms and for scale invariance a dilaton field phi are considered in the action. The first-order formalism is applied. The integration of the equations of motion associated with the new measure gives rise to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of scale invariance (SI). After SSB of SI, it is found that a nontrivial potential for the dilaton is generated. In the Einstein frame we also add a cosmological term that parametrizes the zero point fluctuations. The resulting effective potential for the dilaton contains two flat regions, for phi -> infinity relevant for the nonsingular origin of the universe, followed by an inflationary phase and phi -> -infinity, describing our present universe. The dynamics of the scalar field becomes nonlinear and these nonlinearities produce a nontrivial vacuum structure for the theory and are responsible for the stability of some of the emergent universe solutions, which exists for a parameter range of values of the vacuum energy in phi -> -infinity, which must be positive but not very big, avoiding the extreme fine tuning required to keep the vacuum energy density of the present universe small. The nontrivial vacuum structure is crucial to ensure the smooth transition from the emerging phase, to an inflationary phase and finally to the slowly accelerated universe now. Zero vacuum energy density for the present universe defines the threshold for the creation of the universe.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
EXTENDED SPHERICAL COLLAPSE AND THE ACCELERATING UNIVERSE	10.1142/S0218271813500387	The influence of the shear stress and angular momentum on the nonlinear spherical collapse model is discussed in the framework of the Einstein-de Sitter and Lambda CDM models. By assuming that the vacuum component is not clustering within the homogeneous nonspherical overdensities, we show how the local rotation and shear affect the linear density threshold for collapse of the nonrelativistic component (delta(c)) and its virial overdensity (Delta(V)). It is also found that the net effect of shear and rotation in galactic scale is responsible for higher values of the linear overdensity parameter as compared with the standard spherical collapse model (no shear and rotation).

ASTROPHYSICAL EVIDENCE FOR AN EXTRA DIMENSION: PHENOMENOLOGY OF A KALUZA KLEIN THEORY	10.1142/S0217732313300139	In this brief review, we discuss the viability of a multi-dimensional geometrical theory with one compactified dimension. We discuss the case of a Kaluza-Klein (KK) fifth-dimensional theory, addressing the problem by an overview of the astrophysical phenomenology associated with this five-dimensional (5D) theory. By comparing the predictions of our model with the features of the ordinary (four-dimensional (411))) Relativistic Astrophysics, we highlight some small but finite discrepancies, expectably detectible from the observations. We consider a class of static, vacuum solutions of free electromagnetic KK equations with three-dimensional (3D) spherical symmetry. We explore the stability of the particle dynamics in these spacetimes, the construction of self-gravitating stellar models and the emission spectrum generated by a charged particle falling on this stellar object. The matter dynamics in these geometries has been treated by a multipole approach adapted to the geometric theory with a compactified dimension.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Dark Energy from graviton-mediated interactions in the QCD vacuum	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/06/011	Adopting the hypothesis about the exact cancellation of vacuum condensates contributions to the ground state energy in particle physics to the leading order in graviton-mediated interactions, we argue that the observable cosmological constant can be dynamically induced by an uncompensated quantum gravity correction to them after the QCD phase transition epoch. To start with, we demonstrate a possible cancellation of the quark-gluon condensate contribution to the total vacuum energy density of the Universe at temperatures T < 100 MeV without taking into account the graviton-mediated effects. In order to incorporate the latter, we then calculate the leading-order quantum correction to the classical Einstein equations due to metric fluctuations induced by the non-perturbative vacuum fluctuations of the gluon and quark fields in the quasiclassical approximation. It has been demonstrated that such a correction to the vacuum energy density has a form epsilon(Lambda) similar to G Lambda(6)(QCD), where G is the gravitational constant, and Lambda(QCD) is the QCD scale parameter. We analyze capabilities of this approach based on the synthesis between quantum gravity in quasiclassical approximation and theory of non-perturbative QCD vacuum for quantitative explanation of the observed Dark Energy density.

Can dark energy emerge from quantum effects in a compact extra dimension?	10.1051/0004-6361/201321060	The origin of the accelerated expansion of the universe is a major problem in both modern cosmology and theoretical physics. In quantum field theory, simple estimations of the vacuum contribution to the density energy of the Universe are known to lead to catastrophically high values compared to observations. A gravitational Casimir effect from an additional compact dimension of space is known to lead to an effective cosmological constant. Nevertheless, such a contribution by itself is usually not regarded as a plausible source for accelerating the expansion, given the constraints on such scenarios. Here, we propose that the Casimir vacuum contribution of the gravitational field actually provides a low positive value to the density energy of the universe. The key new ingredient is to assume that only modes with shorter wavelengths than the Hubble radius contribute to the vacuum energy. Such a contribution gives a positive energy density, has a naturally Lorentz invariant equation of state in the usual 4D spacetime, and can thus be interpreted as a cosmological constant. Its value agrees with observations for a radius of a fifth extra dimension given by 35 mu m. The implied modification of the gravitational inverse square law is close but below existing limits from experiments testing gravity at short range.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Linearly Varying Deceleration Parameter in Viscous Bianchi Type I Universe	10.1007/s40010-012-0054-4	We investigate a class of cosmological models in the background of homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type I space-time for viscous fluid distribution by constraining the deceleration parameter in the presence of dark energy represented by a time-varying cosmological constant. We discuss, in the context of some vacuum decay laws, the cosmological implications of the corresponding solutions. The models have finite life time. They start with a big bang and end in a big rip. The models isotropize and the presence of shear viscosity accelerates the isotropization process. The variations of different cosmological parameters are shown graphically.

GRB Hubble diagram and constraints on a Lambda(t) CDM model	10.1093/mnras/stt409	In previous papers, a cosmological model with constant rate particle creation and vacuum term decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter was shown to lead to a good concordance when tested against precise observations: the position of the first peak in the spectrum of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Hubble diagram for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), the distribution of large-scale structures and the distance to the baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). That model has the same number of parameters as the spatially flat standard model and seems to alleviate some observational/theoretical tensions appearing in the latter. In this paper, we complement those tests with 109 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 59 of them with redshifts above z = 1.4, which permits to extend the Hubble diagram to redshifts up to z approximate to 8. For the calibration of the 50 GRBs with z < 1.4, we use the 288 supernovae of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey project, calibrated with the MLCS2k2 fitter, less model-dependent than other samples like Union2. Our results show a good concordance with the previous tests and, again, less tensions between SNe Ia and GRB best fits as compared to the standard model.

Dark energy and dark matter as due to zero point energy	10.1017/S0022377812001055	An attempt is made to explain dark energy and dark matter of the expanding universe in terms of the zero point vacuum energy. This analysis is mainly limited to later stages of an observable nearly flat universe. It is based on a revised formulation of the spectral distribution of the zero point energy, for an ensemble in a defined statistical equilibrium having finite total energy density. The steady and dynamic states are studied for a spherical cloud of zero point energy photons. The `antigravitational' force due to its pressure gradient then represents dark energy, and its gravitational force due to the energy density represents dark matter. Four fundamental results come out of the theory. First, the lack of emitted radiation becomes reconcilable with the concepts of dark energy and dark matter. Second, the crucial coincidence problem of equal orders of magnitude of mass density and vacuum energy density cannot be explained by the cosmological constant, but is resolved by the present variable concepts, which originate from the same photon gas balance. Third, the present approach becomes reconcilable with cosmical dimensions and with the radius of the observable universe. Fourth, the deduced acceleration of the expansion agrees with the observed one. In addition, mass polarity of a generalized gravitation law for matter and antimatter is proposed as a source of dark flow.	JOURNAL OF PLASMA PHYSICS
Discrete torsion, de Sitter tunneling vacua and AdS brane: U(1) gauge theory of D-4-brane and an effective curvature	10.1007/JHEP05(2013)033	The U(1) gauge dynamics on a D-4-brane is revisited, with a two form, to construct an effective curvature theory in a second order formalism. We exploit the local degrees in a two form, and modify its dynamics in a gauge invariant way, to incorporate a non-perturbative metric fluctuation in an effective D-4-brane. Interestingly, the near horizon D-4-brane is shown to describe an asymptotic Anti de Sitter (AdS) in a semi-classical regime. Using Weyl scaling(s), we obtain the emergent rotating geometries leading to primordial de Sitter (dS) and AdS vacua in a quantum regime. Under a discrete transformation, we re-arrange the mixed dS patches to describe a Schwazschild-like dS (SdS) and a topological-like dS (TdS) black holes. We analyze SdS vacuum for Hawking radiations to arrive at Nariai geometry, where a discrete torsion forms a condensate. We perform thermal analysis to identify Nariai vacuum with a TdS. Investigation reveals an AdS patch within a thermal dS brane, which may provide a clue to unfold dS/CFT. In addition, the role of dark energy, sourced by a discrete torsion, in the dS vacua is investigated using Painleve geometries. It is argued that a D-instanton pair is created by a discrete torsion, with a Big Bang/Crunch, at the past horizon in a pure dS. Nucleation, of brane/anti-brane pair(s), is qualitatively analyzed to construct an effective space-time on a D-4-brane and its anti brane. Analysis re-assures the significant role played by a non-zero mode, of NS-NS two form, to generalize the notion of branes within a brane.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Unified dark energy-dark matter model with inverse quintessence	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/05/036	We consider a model where both dark energy and dark matter originate from the coupling of a scalar field with a non-canonical kinetic term to, both, a metric measure and a non-metric measure. An interacting dark energy/dark matter scenario can be obtained by introducing an additional scalar that can produce non constant vacuum energy and associated variations in dark matter. The phenomenology is most interesting when the kinetic term of the additional scalar field is ghost-type, since in this case the dark energy vanishes in the early universe and then grows with time. This constitutes an ``inverse quintessence scenario{''	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Expansion history with decaying vacuum: a complete cosmological scenario	10.1093/mnras/stt220	We propose a novel cosmological scenario with the space-time emerging from a pure initial de Sitter stage and subsequently evolving into the radiation, matter and dark energy dominated epochs, thereby avoiding the initial singularity and providing a complete description of the expansion history and a natural solution to the horizon problem. The model is based on a dynamical vacuum energy density which evolves as a power series of the Hubble rate. The transit from the inflation into the standard radiation epoch is universal, giving a clue for a successful description of the graceful exit. Since the resulting late time cosmic history is very close to the concordance Lambda cold dark matter model, the new unified framework embodies a more complete past cosmic evolution than the standard cosmology.

On the nature of dark energy: the lattice Universe	10.1007/s10509-013-1388-3	There is something unknown in the cosmos. Something big. Which causes the acceleration of the Universe expansion, that is perhaps the most surprising and unexpected discovery of the last decades, and thus represents one of the most pressing mysteries of the Universe. The current standard I > CDM model uses two unknown entities to make everything fit: dark energy and dark matter, which together would constitute more than 95 \% of the energy density of the Universe. A bit like saying that we have understood almost nothing, but without openly admitting it. Here we start from the recent theoretical results that come from the extension of general relativity to antimatter, through CPT symmetry. This theory predicts a mutual gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter. Our basic assumption is that the Universe contains equal amounts of matter and antimatter, with antimatter possibly located in cosmic voids, as discussed in previous works. From this scenario we develop a simple cosmological model, from whose equations we derive the first results. While the existence of the elusive dark energy is completely replaced by gravitational repulsion, the presence of dark matter is not excluded, but not strictly required, as most of the related phenomena can also be ascribed to repulsive-gravity effects. With a matter energy density ranging from similar to 5 \% (baryonic matter alone, and as much antimatter) to similar to 25 \% of the so-called critical density, the present age of the Universe varies between about 13 and 15 Gyr. The SN Ia test is successfully passed, with residuals comparable with those of the I > CDM model in the observed redshift range, but with a clear prediction for fainter SNe at higher z. Moreover, this model has neither horizon nor coincidence problems, and no initial singularity is requested. In conclusion, we have replaced all the tough problems of the current standard cosmology (including the matter-antimatter asymmetry) with only one question: is the gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter really repulsive as predicted by the theory and as the observation of the Universe seems to suggest? We are awaiting experimental responses.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
DBI Galileons in the Einstein frame: Local gravity and cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.083010	It is shown that a disformally coupled theory in which the gravitational sector has the Einstein-Hilbert form is equivalent to a quartic Dirac-Born-Infeld Galileon Lagrangian, possessing nonlinear higher derivative interactions, and hence allowing for the Vainshtein effect. This Einstein frame description considerably simplifies the dynamical equations and highlights the role of the different terms. The study of highly dense, nonrelativistic environments within this description unravels the existence of a disformal screening mechanism, while the study of static vacuum configurations reveals the existence of a Vainshtein radius, at which the asymptotic solution breaks down. Disformal couplings to matter also allow the construction of dark energy models, which behave differently than conformally coupled ones and introduce new effects on the growth of large scale structure over cosmological scales, on which the scalar force is not screened. We consider a simple disformally coupled dark matter model in detail, in which standard model particles follow geodesics of the gravitational metric and only dark matter is affected by the disformal scalar field. This particular model is not compatible with observations in the linearly perturbed regime. Nonetheless, disformally coupled theories offer enough freedom to construct realistic cosmological scenarios, which can be distinguished from the standard model through characteristic signatures.

New asymptotically flat phantom wormhole solutions	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.084030	A possible cause of the late-time cosmic acceleration is an exotic fluid with an equation of state lying within the phantom regime, i.e., w = p/rho < -1. This violates the null energy condition, which is a fundamental ingredient in wormhole physics. Thus, cosmic phantom energy may, in principle, provide a natural fluid to support wormholes. In this work, we find new asymptotically flat wormhole solutions supported by the phantom energy equation of state, consequently extending previous solutions. Thus, there is no need to surgically paste the interior wormhole geometry to an exterior vacuum spacetime. In the first example, we carefully construct a specific shape function, where the energy density and pressures vanish at large distances as similar to 1/r(n), with n > 0. We also consider the ``volume integral quantifier,'' which provides useful information regarding the total amount of energy-condition-violating matter, and show that, in principle, it is possible to construct asymptotically flat wormhole solutions with an arbitrary small amount of energy-condition-violating matter. In the second example, we analyze two equations of state, i.e., p(r) = p(r)(rho) and p(t) = p(t)(rho), where we consider a specific integrability condition in order to obtain exact asymptotically flat wormhole solutions. In the final example, we postulate a smooth energy density profile, possessing a maximum at the throat and vanishing at spatial infinity. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.084030	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Probing interaction in the dark sector	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.087301	A phenomenological attempt at alleviating the so-called coincidence problem is to allow the dark matter and dark energy to interact. By assuming a specific class of coupled quintessence models, characterized by a constant interaction parameter epsilon, we investigate the precision in the measurements of the expansion rate H(z) required by future experiments in order to detect a possible deviation from the standard Lambda CDM model (epsilon = 0). We perform our analysis at two levels, namely, through Monte Carlo simulations based on epsilon CDM models, in which H(z) samples with different accuracies are generated and through an analytic method that calculates the error propagation of epsilon as a function of the error in H(z). We show that our analytical approach traces simulations accurately and find that to detect an interaction using H(z) data only, these must reach an accuracy better than 1\%.

Cosmological constraints on a decomposed Chaplygin gas	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.083503	Any unified dark matter cosmology can be decomposed into dark matter interacting with vacuum energy, without introducing any additional degrees of freedom. We present observational constraints on an interacting vacuum plus dark energy corresponding to a generalized Chaplygin gas cosmology. We consider two distinct models for the interaction leading to either a barotropic equation of state or dark matter that follows geodesics, corresponding to a rest-frame sound speed equal to the adiabatic sound speed or zero sound speed, respectively. For the barotropic model, the most stringent constraint on alpha comes from the combination of CMB + SNIa + LSS(m) gives alpha < 5.66 x 10(-6) at the 95\% confidence level, which indicates that the barotropic model must be extremely close to the Lambda CDM cosmology. For the case where the dark matter follows geodesics, perturbations have zero sound speed, and CMB + SNIa + gISW then gives the much weaker constraint -0.15< alpha < 0.26 at the 95\% confidence level.

Gas of wormholes as a model for dark energy	10.1134/S0202289313020096	We assume that some amount of dark energy appears due to vacuum polarization in external classical fields. In the early Universe, perturbations in this energy may form actual wormholes. We show that actual wormholes give a negligible contribution to the change in the vacuum energy density, while their contribution to the mean curvature is apt to form the observed dark energy phenomenon. Using the contribution of wormholes to dark matter and dark energy, we find estimates for the characteristic parameters of the gas of wormholes.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Comment on ``Non-vacuum conformally flat space-times: dark energy{''}	10.1007/s10509-012-1341-x	Ibohal, Ishwarchandra and Singh (Ibohal et al., Astrophys. Space Sci. 335, 581, 2011) proposed a class of exact, non-vacuum and conformally flat solutions of Einstein's equations whose stress tensor T (ab) has negative pressure. We show that T (ab) corresponds to an anisotropic fluid and the equation of state parameter seems not to be omega=-1/2. We consider the authors' constant cannot be the mass of a test particle but is related to a Rindler acceleration of a spherical distribution of uniformly accelerating observers.

Canonical and phantom scalar fields as an interaction of two perfect fluids	10.1007/s10509-012-1346-5	In this article we investigate and develop specific aspects of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) scalar field cosmologies related to the interpretation that canonical and phantom scalar field sources may be interpreted as cosmological configurations with a mixture of two interacting barotropic perfect fluids: a matter component rho (1)(t) with a stiff equation of state (p (1)=rho (1)), and an ``effective vacuum energy{''} rho (2)(t) with a cosmological constant equation of state (p (2)=-rho (2)). An important characteristic of this alternative equivalent formulation in the framework of interacting cosmologies is that it gives, by choosing a suitable form of the interacting term Q, an approach for obtaining exact and numerical solutions. The choice of Q merely determines a specific scalar field with its potential, thus allowing to generate closed, open and flat FRW scalar field cosmologies.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Steady Flow cosmological model	10.1007/s10509-012-1349-2	The possibility that the cosmological constant is decaying as the observable universe grows is explored, and we define a cosmological parameter, depending of the vacuum energy and the universe radius, which should be presently ca. 122 orders of magnitude smaller than at the Planck epoch. From it, a new version of the Friedmann equation for a flat universe is obtained, which allows the estimation of the Hubble parameter at any epoch and the reconstruction of the expansion history. The main result is a quasi-linear expansion dynamics in concurrence with a number of previous works. This behavior is compatible with the main features of observational cosmology and avoids the horizon, flatness, cosmological constant, coincidence and age problems without the need of neither inflation nor initial fine-tuning.

On the absence of the usual weak-field limit, and the impossibility of embedding some known solutions for isolated masses in cosmologies with f(R) dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.063517	The problem of matching different regions of spacetime in order to construct inhomogeneous cosmological models is investigated in the context of Lagrangian theories of gravity constructed from general analytic functions f(R), and from nonanalytic theories with f(R) = R-n. In all of the cases studied, we find that it is impossible to satisfy the required junction conditions without the large-scale behavior reducing to that expected from Einstein's equations with a cosmological constant. For theories with analytic f(R) this suggests that the usual treatment of weak-field systems as perturbations about Minkowski space may not be compatible with late-time acceleration driven by anything other than a constant term of the form f(0), which acts like a cosmological constant. In the absence of Minkowski space as a suitable background for weak-field systems, one must then choose and justify some other solution to perform perturbative analyses around. For theories with f(R) = R-n we find that no known spherically symmetric vacuum solutions can be matched to an expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background. This includes the absence of any Einstein-Straus-like embeddings of the Schwarzschild exterior solution in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes.

Accelerated expansion from ghost-free bigravity: a statistical analysis with improved generality	10.1007/JHEP03(2013)099	We study the background cosmology of the ghost-free, bimetric theory of gravity. We perform an extensive statistical analysis of the model using both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks and employ the constraints on the expansion history of the Universe from the observations of supernovae, the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure to estimate the model's parameters and test the goodness of the fits. We explore the parameter space of the model with nested sampling to find the best-fit chi-square, obtain the Bayesian evidence, and compute the marginalized posteriors and mean likelihoods. We mainly focus on a class of sub-models with no explicit cosmological constant (or vacuum energy) term to assess the ability of the theory to dynamically cause a late-time accelerated expansion. The model behaves as standard gravity without a cosmological constant at early times, with an emergent extra contribution to the energy density that converges to a cosmological constant in the far future. The model can in most cases yield very good fits and is in perfect agreement with the data. This is because many points in the parameter space of the model exist that give rise to time-evolution equations that are effectively very similar to those of the Lambda CDM. This similarity makes the model compatible with observations as in the Lambda CDM case, at least at the background level. Even though our results indicate a slightly better fit for the Lambda CDM concordance model in terms of the p-value and evidence, none of the models is statistically preferred to the other. However, the parameters of the bigravity model are in general degenerate. A similar but perturbative analysis of the model as well as more data will be required to break the degeneracies and constrain the parameters, in case the model will still be viable compared to the Lambda CDM.

Dynamical vacuum energy and phantom divide-line cross in scalar cosmology	10.1007/s12648-012-0200-5	In this paper, we study cosmological models in scalar tensor theory of gravity a la Brans-Dicke with a dynamical equation of state parameter, a dynamical effective cosmological constant and a Hubble parameter varying like with and are real positive parameters and is some pending power index. It is observed that the universe is accelerating in time and it is dominated by a decreasing energy density and a vacuum energy density. However the vacuum energy density is increasing logarithmically at early epoch of time and then decaying toward its present positive value at late-time epoch. For specific choices of the free parameters in the theory, it is observed that the phantom divide line is crossed in the presence of a cosmological constant and the universe expands asymptotically a la de-Sitter at very large time. Additional features are discussed as well.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
SU(1,1) Lie algebraic approach for the evolution of the quantum inflationary universe	10.1016/j.dark.2013.02.002	Quantum behavior of scalar fields and vacuum energy density in inflationary universe are investigated using SU(1,1) Lie algebraic approach. Wave functions describing the evolution of scalar fields thought to have driven cosmic inflation are identified in several possible quantum states at the early stage of the universe, such as the Fock state, the Glauber coherent state, and SU(1,1) coherent states. In particular, we focus in this research on two important classes of SU(1,1) coherent states, so-called the even and odd coherent states and the Perelomov coherent state. It is shown in spatially flat universe driven by a single scalar field that the probability densities in all these states have converged to the origin (phi = 0, where phi is the scalar field) as time goes by. This outcome implies that the vacuum energy density characterized by the scalar field dissipates with time. The probability density in the matter-dominated era converged more rapidly than that in the radiation-dominated era. Hence, we can confirm that the progress of dissipation for vacuum energy density became faster as the matter era began after the end of the early dominance of radiation. This consequence is, indeed, well agree with the results of our previous researches in cosmology (for example, see [Chin. Phys. C 35 (2011) 233] and references there in). (C) 2013 Jeong Ryeol Choi.

Withholding potentials, absence of ghosts, and relationship between minimal dilatonic gravity and f(R) theories	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044053	We study the relation between minimal dilatonic gravity (MDG) and f(R) theories of gravity and establish strict conditions for their global equivalence. Such equivalence takes place only for a certain class of cosmological potentials, dubbed here ``withholding potentials,{''} since they prevent change of the sign of the dilaton Phi. The withholding property ensures the attractive character of gravity, as well as absence of ghosts and a tachyon in the gravi-dilaton sector and yields certain asymptotic of the functions f(R). Large classes of withholding cosmological potentials and functions f(R) are found and described in detail. The particle content of the gravi-dilaton sector is found using perturbation theory around the de Sitter vacuum of MDG. Two phenomena, scalaron waves and induction of gravitational waves by the scalaron field, are discussed using the derived wave equations for MDG scalaron and graviton in the de Sitter background. Seemingly, the MDG and f(R) theories offer a unified description of dark energy and dark matter. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044053	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Neutrino generated dynamical dark energy with no dark energy field	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044021	Dynamical dark energy (DE) phenomenon emerges as a geometrical effect accompanying the cosmological expansion of nonrelativistic fermionic matter. This occurs without the need for any fluid, like dynamical scalar field (quintessence, cosmon, etc.), and with conventional form of the Einstein equations in contrast to other known geometrical DE models. The phenomenon results from first principles in the framework of the two measures field theory where, in the Einstein frame, both fermion masses and the cosmological constant (CC) turn into functions of the cold fermion density n. This n dependence becomes negligible in regular (laboratory) conditions, but it may have an important role in cosmology. In the 4D gravity model where the original action involves only CC and massive fermions without self-interaction, for different (but wide) regions in the parameter space, we have found two possible classes of scenarios for the late universe starting from the cold matter domination era. We argue that the fermions which drive the variable CC should be associated with cold neutrinos disposed in voids and supervoids. The cosmological dynamics of the first class practically coincides with that of the Lambda CDM model, while the dynamics of the second class is of the phantomlike regime with a pseudo-rip scenario. Crossing the phantom divide happens due to a new type of the neutrino DE effect where neutrinos pass through the state with zero mass and with the vacuumlike EoS P-v = -rho(v).

Irreversible thermodynamic description of interacting dark energy-dark matter cosmological models	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044018	We investigate the interaction between dark energy and dark matter in the framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open systems with matter creation/annihilation. We consider dark energy and dark matter as an interacting two-component (scalar field and ``ordinary{''} dark matter) cosmological fluid in a homogeneous spatially flat and isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. The thermodynamics of open systems as applied together with the gravitational field equations to the two-component cosmological fluid leads to a generalization of the elementary dark energy-dark matter interaction theory, in which the decay (creation) pressures are explicitly considered as parts of the cosmological fluid stress-energy tensor. Specific models describing coherently oscillating scalar waves, leading to a high particle production at the beginning of the oscillatory period, and models with a constant potential energy scalar field are considered. Furthermore, exact and numerical solutions of the gravitational field equations with dark energy-dark matter interactions are also obtained. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.044018	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Particle creation in flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of f(T) gravity	10.1139/cjp-2012-0427	We study particle production in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe in the framework of f(T) gravity. An exact power-law solution is obtained by solving the Friedmann equations and assuming that matter is minimally coupled with gravitation. The torsion scalar, T, appears to plays the same role as the curvature (Ricci scalar) in general relativity (GR) and its modified theories, f(R). Particularly, in the phantom phase, we observe that the vacuum state corresponds to a vanishing torsion scalar and particle production becomes important as the torsion scalar diverges. This aspect not only provides the equivalence between teleparallel gravity and GR, but also between their respective modified versions, f(T) and f(R), in the view of massless particle production phenomenon when matter is minimally coupled with gravity. However, when the gravitational and scalar fields are not minimally coupled, it appears that this similarity between the teleparallel gravity and GR may break down, because the torsion scalar no longer has the same time-dependent expression as the Ricci scalar.

Latest observational constraints to the ghost dark energy model by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.023006	Recently, the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost field in a time-dependent background was proposed as a kind of dark energy candidate called the ghost dark energy model (GDE) to explain the acceleration of the Universe. In this model, the energy density of the dark energy is proportional to the Hubble parameter H, which is also regarded as the Hawking temperature on the Hubble horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe. In this paper, the statefinder and Om diagnostics are applied to the GDE models, and the differences among them are significant during the time of transition. And at that time, the viscosity plays an important role. Furthermore, we find that once the viscosity is taken into account, the age problem of Universe could be alleviated. We also perform a constraint on the GDE models with and without bulk viscosity by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and the combined latest observational data from the type Ia supernova compilations including Union2.1(580) and Union2(557), cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, and the observational Hubble parameter data.

Why is the running vacuum energy more benign than the holographic Ricci dark energy?	10.1103/PhysRevD.87.023515	A very interesting generalization of the running vacuum energy density has been recently advanced [S. Basilakos, D. Polarski, and J. Sola, Phys. Rev. D 86, 043010 (2012)]. The Friedmann equation of this model looks pretty much similar to that of a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with an holographic Ricci dark energy (HRDE) component. Despite the analogy between these two models, it turns out that one of them, generalization of the running vacuum energy, is singularity-free in the future while the other, HRDE, is not. Indeed, a universe filled with an HRDE component can hit, for example, a big rip singularity. We clarify this issue by solving analytically the Friedmann equation for both models and analyzing the role played by the local conservation of the energy density of the different components when filling the universe. In addition, not everything is bad news about the HRDE. In fact, we point out that in some particular cases the HRDE, when endowed with a negative cosmological constant and in the absence of an explicit dark matter component, can mimic dark matter and explain the late-time cosmic acceleration of the universe through an asymptotically de Sitter universe.

Symmetron Dark Energy in Laboratory Experiments	10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.031301	The symmetron scalar field is a matter-coupled dark energy candidate which effectively decouples from matter in high-density regions through a symmetry restoration. We consider a previously unexplored regime, in which the vacuum mass mu similar to 2.4 x 10(-3) eV of the symmetron is near the dark energy scale, and the matter coupling parameter M similar to 1 TeV is just beyond standard model energies. Such a field will give rise to a fifth force at submillimeter distances which can be probed by short-range gravity experiments. We show that a torsion pendulum experiment such as Eot-Wash can exclude symmetrons in this regime for all self-couplings lambda less than or similar to 7.5.

A simple model of universe describing the early inflation and the late accelerated expansion in a symmetric manner	10.1063/1.4817032	We construct a simple model of universe which ``unifies{''} vacuum energy and radiation on the one hand, and matter and dark energy on the other hand in the spirit of a generalized Chaplygin gas model. Specifically, the phases of early inflation and late accelerated expansion are described by a generalized equation of state p/c(2) = alpha rho + k rho(1+1/n) having a linear component p = alpha rho c(2) and a polytropic component p = k rho(1+1/n)c(2). For alpha = 1/3, n = 1 and k = -4/(3 rho(P)), where rho(P) = 5.1610(99) g/m(3) is the Planck density, this equation of state describes the transition between the vacuum energy era and the radiation era. For t >= 0, the universe undergoes an inflationary expansion that brings it from the Planck size l(P) = 1.6210(-35) m to a size a(1) = 2.61 10(-6) m on a timescale of about 23.3 Planck times t(P) = 5.3910(-44) s (early inflation). When t > t(1) = 23.3t(P), the universe decelerates and enters in the radiation era. We interpret the transition from the vacuum energy era to the radiation era as a second order phase transition where the Planck constant (h) over bar plays the role of finite size effects (the standard Big Bang theory is recovered for (h) over bar = 0). For alpha = 0, n = -1 and k = -rho(Lambda), where rho(Lambda) = 7.0210(-24) g/m(3) is the cosmological density, the equation of state p/c(2) = alpha rho + k rho(1+1/n) describes the transition from a decelerating universe dominated by pressureless matter (baryonic and dark matter) to an accelerating universe dominated by dark energy (late inflation). This transition takes place at a size a(2) = 0.204l(Lambda) corresponding to a time t(2) = 0.203t(Lambda) where l(Lambda) = 4.3810(26)m is the cosmological length and t(Lambda) = 1.4610(18) s the cosmological time. The present universe turns out to be just at the transition between these two periods (t(0) similar to t(2)). Our model gives the same results as the standard Lambda CDM model for t >> t(P) and completes it by incorporating a phase of early inflation for t < 23.3t(P) in a very natural manner. Furthermore, it reveals a nice ``symmetry{''} between the early and the late evolution of the universe. The early universe is modeled by a polytrope n = +1 and the late universe by a polytrope n = -1. Furthermore, the cosmological constant. in the late universe plays a role similar to the Planck constant <(h)over bar> in the early universe. The mathematical formulae in the early and in the late universe are then strikingly symmetric. We interpret the cosmological constant as a fundamental constant of Nature describing the ``cosmophysics{''} just like the Planck constant describes the ``microphysics{''}. The Planck density and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper and lower bounds differing by 122 orders of magnitude. The cosmological constant ``problem{''} may be a false problem. Finally, we show that our model admits a scalar field interpretation based on a quintessence field or a tachyon field.	"IX MEXICAN SCHOOL ON GRAVITATION AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS: COSMOLOGY FOR

Primordial Dark Energy from a Condensate of Spinors in a 5D Vacuum	10.1155/2013/789476	We explore the possibility that the expansion of the universe can be driven by a condensate of spinors which are free of interactions in a 5D relativistic vacuum defined in an extended de Sitter spacetime which is Riemann flat. The extra coordinate is considered as noncompact. After making a static foliation on the extra coordinate, we obtain an effective 4D (inflationary) de Sitter expansion which describes an inflationary universe. We found that the condensate of spinors studied here could be an interesting candidate to explain the presence of dark energy in the early universe. The dark energy density which we are talking about is poured into smaller subhorizon scales with the evolution of the inflationary expansion.	ADVANCES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS

It is a gravitationally bound quantum system consisting of a nucleus represented by a regular primordial black hole (RPBH), its remnant or gravitational vacuum soliton G-lump, and a charged particle. We estimate probability of formation of RPBHs and G-lumps in the early Universe and evaluate energy spectrum and electromagnetic radiation of graviatom which can in principle bear information about a fundamental symmetry scale responsible for de Sitter interior and serve as its observational signatures.

Cosmological constant and vacuum energy: old and new ideas	10.1088/1742-6596/453/1/012015	The cosmological constant (CC) term in Einstein's equations, A, was first associated to the idea of vacuum energy density. Notwithstanding, it is well-known that there is a huge, in fact appalling, discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the observed value picked from the modern cosmological data. This is the famous, and extremely difficult, ``CC problem{''}. Paradoxically, the recent observation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider of a Higgs-like particle, should actually be considered ambivalent: on the one hand it appears as a likely great triumph of particle physics, but on the other hand it wide opens Pandora's box of the cosmological uproar, for it may provide (alas!) the experimental certification of the existence of the electroweak (EW) vacuum energy, and thus of the intriguing reality of the CC problem. Even if only counting on this contribution to the inventory of vacuum energies in the universe, the discrepancy with the cosmologically observed value is already of 55 orders of magnitude. This is the (hitherto) ``real{''} magnitude of the CC problem, rather than the (too often) brandished 123 ones from the upper (but fully unexplored!) ultrahigh energy scales. Such is the baffling situation after 96 years of introducing the A-term by Einstein. In the following I will briefly (and hopefully pedagogically) fly over some of the old and new ideas on the CC problem. Since, however, the Higgs boson just knocked our door and recalled us that the vacuum energy may be a fully tangible concept in real phenomenology, I will exclusively address the CC problem from the original notion of vacuum energy, and its possible ``running{''} with the expansion of the universe, rather than venturing into the numberless attempts to replace the CC by the multifarious concept of dark energy.

THE QUANTUM-FIELD VACUUM MODEL OF DARK ENERGY		The gravitational mechanism of the radical reduction, comparing with the predictions of the local quantum field theory, of physical vacuum energy density is considered. It is shown that the account of self-gravitation of the quantum vacuum fluctuations decreases the total energy of fluctuations of the Planck size to zero, transforming them in topologically closed configurations. The total energy is defined as the positive self-energy of fluctuation plus the negative energy of its self-gravitation. By reasons of statistical physics, a hypothesis about the crystal-like ordering of the whole system of massless ``Planck cells{''} is suggested. In this massless (or almost massless) crystal-like structure the subsystem of vacuum condensates with positive energy is integrated. The condition for the topological closure of Universe allows us to obtain an upper bound for positive energy density in the system close to the currently observed value.

THE SUPERFLUIDITY OF VACUUM CONDENSATES AND THE VACUUM MODEL OF DARK MATTER		We assume that the vacuum condensates, being the bound coherent quantum systems like quantum liquids in macro-physics, have the property of superfluidity. Therefore, they should freely flow into the galactic black holes and into the high-temperature regions of galaxies due to thermomechanical effect inherent to superfluid liquids. The vacuum condensates that flows into the galaxies, having become inhomogeneous, create a gravitational effect of dark matter and form the halos of galaxies. The stationary regime of the radial inflow is considered and it is shown that in this regime the ratio of the total mass of dark matter to the total mass of dark energy is approximately equal to 1/3, that is in satisfactory agreement with observations.

f (R) in Holographic and Agegraphic Dark Energy Models and the Generalized Uncertainty Principle	10.1155/2013/143195	We studied a unified approach with the holographic, new agegraphic, and f (R) dark energy model to construct the form of f (R) which in general is responsible for the curvature driven explanation of the very early inflation along with presently observed late time acceleration. We considered the generalized uncertainty principle in our approach which incorporated the corrections in the entropy-area relation and thereby modified the energy densities for the cosmological dark energy models considered. We found that holographic and new agegraphic f (R) gravity models can behave like phantom or quintessence models in the spatially flat FRW universe. We also found a distinct term in the form of f (R) which goes as R-3/2 due to the consideration of the GUP modified energy densities. Although the presence of this term in the action can be important in explaining the early inflationary scenario, Capozziello et al. recently showed that f (R) similar to R-3/2 leads to an accelerated expansion, that is, a negative value for the deceleration parameter.. which fits well with SNeIa and WMAP data.

Living with ghosts in Lorentz invariant theories	10.1088/1475-7516/2013/01/036	We argue that theories with ghosts may have a long lived vacuum state even if all interactions are Lorentz preserving. In space-time dimension D = 2, we consider the tree level decay rate of the vacuum into ghosts and ordinary particles mediated by non-derivative interactions, showing that this is finite and logarithmically growing in time. For D > 2, the decay rate is divergent unless we assume that the interaction between ordinary matter and the ghost sector is soft in the UV, so that it can be described in terms of non-local form factors rather than point-like vertices. We provide an example of a nonlocal gravitational-strength interaction between the two sectors, which appears to satisfy all observational constraints.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Degeneracy pressure of relic neutrinos and cosmic coincidence problem	10.1139/cjp-2012-0166	We consider the universe as a huge nu(R)-sphere formed with degenerate relic neutrinos and suggest that its constant energy density play a role of an effective cosmological constant. We construct the sphere as a bubble of true vacuum in a field theory model with a spontaneously broken U(1) global symmetry, and we interpret the sphere-forming time as the transition time for recent acceleration of the universe. The coincidence problem may be regarded as naturally resolved in this model, because the relic neutrinos can make the nu(R)-sphere at the recent past time during the matter-dominated era.

An impact model of Newton's law of gravitation	10.1007/s10509-012-1206-3	The far-reaching gravitational force-in the approximation of Newton's law of gravitation-is described by a heuristic model with hypothetical massless particles propagating at the speed of light in vacuum and transferring momentum and energy between physical entities through interactions on a local basis. The model has some similarities with the impact theory presented by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier to the Royal Society in 1690. Objections raised against this idea are dispelled by invoking the Special Theory of Relativity, considering non-local interactions, and replacing the shielding concept by a secular mass increase of massive bodies. Some consequences and applications of the model are discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Bianchi type-I cosmological models with time dependent q and Lambda-term in general relativity	10.1007/s10509-012-1239-7	On getting motivation from increasing evidence for the need of a geometry that resembles Bianchi morphology to explain the observed anisotropy in the WMAP data, Einstein's field equations with variable cosmological ``constant{''} are considered in presence of perfect fluid for a homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I space-time. Einstein's field equations are solved by considering a time dependent deceleration parameter which affords a late time acceleration in the universe. The cosmological constant I > is found to be a decreasing function of time and it approaches a small positive value at the present epoch which is corroborated by consequences from recent supernovae Ia observations. From recently developed Statefinder pair, the behavior of different stages of the evolution of the universe has been studied. The physical significance of the cosmological models have also been discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Phantom Appearance of Non-phantom Matter in Bianchi Type-I Cosmological Model	10.1007/s10773-012-1300-x	Two cosmological models with non-phantom matter having the same expansion of the universe as phantom cosmologies are constructed in Bianchi type-I universe. The exact solutions to the corresponding Einstein field equations have been obtained. The cosmological parameters have been obtained in two interesting cases (i) gamma=0 and (ii) gamma=1/3. We have also discussed the well-known astrophysical phenomena, namely the look-back time, luminosity distance and event horizon with redshift.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Galactic dark matter in the phantom field	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.123015	We investigate the possibility that the galactic dark matter exists in a scenario where the phantom field is responsible for the dark energy. We obtain the statically and spherically approximate solution for this kind of galaxy system with a supermassive black hole at its center. The solution of the metric functions is satisfied with g(tt) = -g(rr)(-1). Constrained by the observation of the rotational stars moving in circular orbits with nearly constant tangential speed in a spiral galaxy, the background of the phantom field which is spatially inhomogeneous has an exponential potential. To avoid the well-known quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies, the phantom field defined in an effective theory is valid only at low energies. Under this assumption, we further investigate the following properties. The absorption cross section of the low-energy S-wave excitations of the phantom field into the central black hole is shown to be the horizontal area of the central black hole. Because the infalling phantom particles have a total negative energy, the accretion of the phantom energy is related to the decrease of the black hole mass, which is estimated to be much less than a solar mass in the lifetime of the Universe. Using a simple model with the cold dark matter very weakly coupled to the ``low-frequency{''} phantom particles that are generated from the background, we show that these two densities can be quasistable in the galaxy.

INFLATION AND ACCELERATING UNIVERSE IN MODIFIED MODULAR INVARIANT SUPERGRAVITY	10.1142/S0217751X12501801	A method of explaining the recently observed acceleration of cosmic expansion as well as inflation in the early universe is presented within the same framework. The goal is to construct an inflation model based on supergravity and the slow-roll approximation (SRA) that both satisfactorily predicts observed inflationary parameters and at the same time explains the accelerated expansion of the universe. The model is based on a modification of string-based modular invariant supergravity previously proposed by the present authors. It realizes slow-roll inflation in the Einstein frame and is successful in explaining Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observational data, through fine-tuning procedure of free parameters. The parameter dependence of the model is considered in detail in order to determine the range for which the SRA can be applied. Within the allowed range of parameter values, a vacuum energy of similar to 10(-120) can be obtained, which coincides with the cosmological constant, and can play the role of dark energy in the universe. The calculated inflationary parameters fit very well to seven-year WMAP data. The ratio of the scalar and tensor power spectra is predicted to be r similar to 6.8 x 10(-2), and this may soon be verified by observations by the Planck satellite. The non-Gaussianity parameter f (N L) is also estimated by the slow-roll parameters.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Wormholes supported by hybrid metric-Palatini gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.127504	Recently, a modified theory of gravity was presented, which consists of the superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an f(R) term constructed a la Palatini. The theory possesses extremely interesting features such as predicting the existence of a long-range scalar field, that explains the late-time cosmic acceleration and passes the local tests, even in the presence of a light scalar field. In this brief report, we consider the possibility that wormholes are supported by this hybrid metric-Palatini gravitational theory. We present here the general conditions for wormhole solutions according to the null energy conditions at the throat and find specific examples. In the first solution, we specify the redshift function, the scalar field and choose the potential that simplifies the modified Klein-Gordon equation. This solution is not asymptotically flat and needs to be matched to a vacuum solution. In the second example, by adequately specifying the metric functions and choosing the scalar field, we find an asymptotically flat spacetime. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.86.127504	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Exact de Sitter solutions in quadratic gravitation with torsion	10.1088/0264-9381/29/23/235022	Several exact cosmological solutions of quadratic gravitation with two torsion functions are presented. These solutions give an essentially different explanation from the one in most of previous works to the cause of the accelerating cosmological expansion and the origin of the torsion of the spacetime. These solutions can be divided into two classes. The solutions in the first class define the critical points of a dynamic system representing an asymptotically stable de Sitter spacetime. The solutions in the second class have exact analytic expressions which have never been found in the literature. The acceleration equation of the universe in general relativity is only a special case of them. These solutions indicate that even in vacuum the spacetime can be endowed with torsion, which means that the torsion of the spacetime has an intrinsic nature and a geometric origin. In these solutions the acceleration of the cosmological expansion is due to either the scalar torsion or the pseudoscalar torsion function. Neither a cosmological constant nor dark energy is needed. It is the torsion of the spacetime that causes the accelerating expansion of the universe in vacuum. All the effects of the inflation, the acceleration and the phase transformation from deceleration to acceleration can be explained by these solutions. Furthermore, the energy and pressure of the matter without spin can produce the torsion of the spacetime and make the expansion of the universe decelerate as well as accelerate.

PHANTOM DARK ENERGY WITH TACHYONIC INSTABILITY: METRIC PERTURBATIONS	10.1007/s11232-012-0142-2	We study the evolution of metric perturbations in a model of UV-stable phantom dark energy. The model has tachyon instabilities at long wavelengths. We find that like the tachyon modes themselves, metric perturbations grow exponentially in time, starting from very small values determined by vacuum fluctuations, and may become sizeable at late times. We derive a constraint on the model parameters that follows from requiring that the metric perturbation amplitudes not be exceedingly large today.	THEORETICAL AND MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
Spherically symmetric analysis on open FLRW solution in non-linear massive gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/12/025	We study non-linear massive gravity in the spherically symmetric context. Our main motivation is to investigate the effect of helicity-0 mode which remains elusive after analysis of cosmological perturbation around an open Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. The non-linear form of the effective energy-momentum tensor stemming from the mass term is derived for the spherically symmetric case. Only in the special case where the area of the two sphere is not deviated away from the FLRW universe, the effective energy momentum tensor becomes completely the same as that of cosmological constant. This opens a window for discriminating the non-linear massive gravity from general relativity (GR). Indeed, by further solving these spherically symmetric gravitational equations of motion in vacuum to the linear order, we obtain a solution which has an arbitrary time-dependent parameter. In GR, this parameter is a constant and corresponds to the mass of a star. Our result means that Birkhoff's theorem no longer holds in the non-linear massive gravity and suggests that energy can probably be emitted superluminously (with infinite speed) on the self-accelerating background by the helicity-0 mode, which could be a potential plague of this theory.

Bulk Viscosity and Decaying Vacuum Density in Friedmann Universe	10.1007/s10773-012-1268-6	We present an isotropic and homogeneous flat cosmological model for bulk viscous fluid distribution. We consider the vacuum density proportional to Hubble expansion parameter and time dependent bulk viscosity related to the velocity and acceleration of universe. The behaviour of resulting solutions are in accordance with recent astronomical observations. The model obtained evolves with a decelerating expansion followed by late time acceleration. Cosmological term I > being very large at initial epoch relaxes to a genuine cosmological constant asymptotically. Presence of bulk viscosity prevents the matter density to vanish asymptotically and the matter density continues to be of the order of vacuum density after a finite time. Thus, we obtain a universe having the possibility of cosmic coincidence.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Born-Infeld-like f(R) gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.103525	Several features of an f(R) theory in which there is a maximum value for the curvature are analyzed. The theory admits all the vacuum solutions of General Relativity, and also the radiation evolution for the scale factor of the standard cosmological model. Working in the Jordan frame, a complete analysis of the phase space is performed, and shown to be in agreement with examples obtained by numerical integration. In particular, nonsingular cosmological solutions were obtained, which after the bounce enter a phase of de Sitter expansion and subsequently relax to a GR-like radiation-dominated evolution.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
New cosmic accelerating scenario without dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.103534	We propose an alternative, nonsingular, cosmic scenario based on gravitationally induced particle production. The model is an attempt to evade the coincidence and cosmological constant problems of the standard model (Lambda CDM) and also to connect the early and late time accelerating stages of the Universe. Our space-time emerges from a pure initial de Sitter stage thereby providing a natural solution to the horizon problem. Subsequently, due to an instability provoked by the production of massless particles, the Universe evolves smoothly to the standard radiation dominated era thereby ending the production of radiation as required by the conformal invariance. Next, the radiation becomes subdominant with the Universe entering in the cold dark matter dominated era. Finally, the negative pressure associated with the creation of cold dark matter (CCDM model) particles accelerates the expansion and drives the Universe to a final de Sitter stage. The late time cosmic expansion history of the CCDM model is exactly like in the standard Lambda CDM model; however, there is no dark energy. The model evolves between two limiting (early and late time) de Sitter regimes. All the stages are also discussed in terms of a scalar field description. This complete scenario is fully determined by two extreme energy densities, or equivalently, the associated de Sitter Hubble scales connected by rho(I)/rho(f) = (H-I/H-f)(2) similar to 10(122), a result that has no correlation with the cosmological constant problem. We also study the linear growth of matter perturbations at the final accelerating stage. It is found that the CCDM growth index can be written as a function of the Lambda growth index, gamma(Lambda) similar or equal to 6/11. In this framework, we also compare the observed growth rate of clustering with that predicted by the current CCDM model. Performing a chi(2) statistical test we show that the CCDM model provides growth rates that match sufficiently well with the observed growth rate of structure.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

We obtain the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations corresponding to this class of theories and show that they recover those of f(R) theories and general relativity in the appropriate limits. We show that the exterior vacuum solutions are of Schwarzschild-de Sitter type and comment on the possible expected modifications, as compared to general relativity, of the interior solutions.

Matter non-conservation in the universe and dynamical dark energy	10.1088/0264-9381/29/21/215002	In an expanding universe, the vacuum energy density rho(Lambda) is expected to be a dynamical quantity. In quantum field theory in curved spacetime, rho(Lambda) should exhibit a slow evolution, determined by the expansion rate of the universe H. Recent measurements on the time variation of the fine-structure constant and of the proton-electron mass ratio suggest that the basic quantities of the standard model, such as the QCD scale parameter Lambda(QCD), may not be conserved in the course of the cosmological evolution. The masses of the nucleons m(N) and of the atomic nuclei would also be affected. Matter is not conserved in such a universe. These measurements can be interpreted as a leakage of matter into vacuum or vice versa. We point out that the amount of leakage necessary to explain the measured value of (m) over dot(N)/m(N) could be of the same order of magnitude as the observationally allowed value of (rho) over dot(Lambda)/rho(Lambda), with a possible contribution from the dark matter particles. The dark energy in our universe could be the dynamical vacuum energy in interaction with ordinary baryonic matter as well as with dark matter.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
String cosmological models from early deceleration to current acceleration phase with varying G and Lambda	10.1140/epjp/i2012-12137-4	The present study deals with spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi-I cosmological models representing massive strings with variable G and decaying vacuum energy density Lambda The energy-momentum tensor, as formulated by Letelier (Phys. Rev. D 20, 1294 (1979); Phys. Rev. D 28, 2414 (1983)), has been used to construct massive string cosmological models for which we assume the expansion scalar in the models is proportional to one of the components of shear tensor and barotropic EoS. The Einstein field equations have been solved by considering the time-dependent deceleration parameter which yields a scale factor a(t) = (sinh(alpha t))(1/n), where n is a positive constant. For n > 1, this generates a transition of the Universe from the early decelerating phase to the recent accelerating phase and the transition redshift z(t) has been calculated. The study reveals that massive strings dominate the early Universe evolving with deceleration and in the later phase they disappear, which is in good agreement with current astronomical observations. The cosmological constant. is found to be a positive decreasing function of time which is corroborated by results from recent Supernovae Ia observations. The physical and geometric properties of the models have been also discussed in detail.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
Cosmological Evolution of Modified Chaplygin Gas with the Sign-Changeable Interactions	10.1007/s10773-012-1224-5	The cosmological evolution of modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) model with the sign-changeable interactions is studied. The key point of the new interaction is the deceleration parameter in the interaction term Q. This new feature gives the possibility that interaction Q can change its sign when the universe changes from deceleration (q > 0) to acceleration (q < 0) and brings different evolution to cosmology. We find that there exist some stable scaling attractors, which can alleviate the coincidence problem. The equation of state (EoS) of MCG approaches the attractor phase from either w (g) >-1 or w (g) <-1 depending on the choice of its initial cosmic density parameter and the ratio of pressure to critical energy density. So, the phantom divide is crossed. Furthermore, we show numerically the evolution of with the proper parameters and find the new interaction Q has a transition from Q < 0 to Q > 0 as the universe expands, which is different from the usual interaction. The numerical calculation shows that a heteroclinic orbit (solution of dynamical system) can interpolate between MCG matter-dominated phase (an unstable critical point) and MCG vacuum-energy-dominated attractor.

Friedmann-Like Equations for High Energy Area of Universe	10.1007/s10773-012-1243-2	In this paper, evolution of the high energy area of universe, through the scenario of 5 dimensional (5D) universe, has been studied. For this purpose, we solve Einstein equations for 5D metric and 5D perfect fluid to derive Friedmann-like equations. Then we obtain the evolution of scale factor and energy density with respect to both space-like and time-like extra dimensions. We obtain the novel equations for the space-like extra dimension and show that the matter with zero pressure cannot exist in the bulk. Also, for dark energy fluid and vacuum fluid, we have both accelerated expansion and contraction in the bulk.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS

We examine the possibility of cosmological models assuming the expansion anisotropy (the ratio sigma/theta of the shear scalar sigma to the volume expansion theta) to be a function of average scale factor R. The resulting models begin with initial anisotropy and approach isotropy at late times. Our models present an initial epoch with decelerating expansion followed by late time acceleration consistent with observations.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Non-vacuum static cylindrically symmetric solution and energy distribution in f(R) gravity	10.1007/s10509-012-1150-2	In this paper, we investigate static cylindrically symmetric solution in metric f(R) gravity by taking matter in the form of dust. The assumption of constant Ricci scalar curvature is taken to find the solution. The energy distribution of this solution is explored by applying Landau-Lifshitz energy-momentum complex. In addition, we explore the stability as well as constant scalar curvature conditions for some viable f(R) models along with their energy distribution. It is interesting to mention here that these models satisfy the above mentioned conditions.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Lorentz gauge quantization in a cosmological space-time	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.084057	It has recently been shown that it is not possible to impose the Lorentz gauge condition in a cosmological space-time using the Gupta-Bleuler method of quantization. It was also shown that it is possible to add del(mu)A(mu) as a new degree of freedom to the electromagnetic field and that this new degree of freedom might be the dark energy which is producing the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I show that the Lorentz gauge condition can be imposed using Dirac's method of quantizing constrained dynamical systems. I also compute the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and show that it vanishes. Thus, in Dirac's approach, the electromagnetic field does not make a contribution to the dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICS EXPLORED WITH HIGH INTENSITY LASER	10.1142/S0217751X1230027X	Over the last century the method of particle acceleration to high energies has become the prime approach to explore the fundamental nature of matter in laboratory. It appears that the latest search of the contemporary accelerator based on the colliders shows a sign of saturation (or at least a slow-down) in increasing its energy and other necessary parameters to extend this frontier. We suggest two pronged approach enabled by the recent progress in high intensity lasers. First we envision the laser-driven plasma accelerator may be able to extend the reach of the collider. For this approach to bear fruit, we need to develop the technology of high averaged power laser in addition to the high intensity. For this we mention that the latest research effort of ICAN is an encouraging sign. In addition to this, we now introduce the concept of the noncollider paradigm in exploring fundamental physics with high intensity (and large energy) lasers. One of the examples we mention is the laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) far beyond TeV without large luminosity. If we relax or do not require the large luminosity necessary for colliders, but solely in ultrahigh energy frontier, we are still capable of exploring such a fundamental issue. Given such a high energetic particle source and high-intensity laser fields simultaneously, we expect to be able to access new aspects on the matter and the vacuum structure from fundamental physical point of views. LWFA naturally exploits the nonlinear optical effects in the plasma when it becomes of relativistic intensity. Normally nonlinear optical effects are discussed based upon polarization susceptibility of matter to external fields. We suggest application of this concept even to the vacuum structure as a new kind of order parameter to discuss vacuum-originating phenomena at semimacroscopic scales. This viewpoint unifies the following observables with the unprecedented experimental environment we envision; the dispersion relation of photons at extremely short wavelengths in vacuum (a test of the Lorentz invariance), the dispersion relation of the vacuum under high-intensity laser fields (nonperturbative QED and possibly QCD effects), and wave-mixing processes possibly caused by exchanges of low-mass and weakly coupling fields relevant to cosmology with the coherent nature of high-flux photons (search for light dark matter and dark energy). These observables based on polarization susceptibility of vacuum would add novel insights to phenomena discovered in cosmology and particle physics where order parameters such as curvature and particle masses are conventionally discussed. In other words the introduction of high intensity laser and its methodology enriches the approach of fundamental and particle physics in entirely new dimensions.

THERMODYNAMIC OF THE GHOST DARK ENERGY UNIVERSE	10.1142/S0217732312501829	Recently, the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background is proposed as a kind of dark energy candidate to explain the acceleration of the Universe. In this model, the energy density of the dark energy is proportional to the Hubble parameter H, which is the Hawking temperature on the Hubble horizon of the FriedmannRobertsonWalker (FRW) Universe. In this paper, we generalized this model and chose the Hawking temperature on the so-called trapping horizon, which will coincide with the Hubble temperature in the context of flat FRW Universe dominated by the dark energy component. We study the thermodynamics of Universe with this kind of dark energy and find that the entropy-area relation is modified, namely, there is another new term besides the area term.

Gravitation theory with a Dirac scalar field in the exterior form formalism and the cosmological constant problem	10.1134/S0202289312040032	As a consequence of the Poincare-Weyl gauge theory of gravity, the space-time possesses the geometric structure of Cartan-Weyl CW (4) space with curvature and torsion 2-forms and a Weyltype nonmetricity 1-form. The Dirac field beta(x) appears as an essential additional geometric component with respect to the metric tensor. The conformal theory of gravity coupled with beta(x) in the exterior form formalism is considered. At an early stage of the universe evolution, we consider these field equations for the spatially flat FRWmetric, assuming the densities of ordinarymatter and dark matter to be very small. Then the field equations can be expressed in terms of the metric tensor and beta(t) only and have an exponentially diminishing solution for beta(t), which can explain an exponential decrease of dark energy (the energy of physical vacuum) as a function of time as a consequence of field dynamics in the ultra-early Universe.

Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking induced by vacuum condensates	10.1016/j.physleta.2012.08.046	We propose a novel mechanism of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking which relies upon a ubiquitous feature of Quantum Field Theory, vacuum condensates. Such condensates play a crucial role in many phenomena. Examples include Unruh effect, superconductors, particle mixing, and quantum dissipative systems. We argue that in all these phenomena supersymmetry, when present, is spontaneously broken. Evidence for our conjecture is given for the Wess-Zumino model, that can be considered as an approximation to the supersymmetric extensions of the above mentioned systems. The magnitude of the effect is estimated for a recently proposed experimental setup based on an optical lattice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS A
TRIPLE-HORIZON SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SPACETIME AND HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE	10.1142/S0218271812420072	We present a family of spherically symmetric spacetimes, specified by the density profile of a vacuum dark energy, which have the same global structure as the de Sitter spacetime but the reduced symmetry which leads to a time-evolving and spatially inhomogeneous cosmological term. It connects smoothly two de Sitter vacua with different values of cosmological constant and corresponds to anisotropic vacuum dark fluid defined by symmetry of its stress-energy tensor which is invariant under the radial boosts. This family contains a special class distinguished by dynamics of evaporation of a cosmological horizon which evolves to the triple horizon with the finite entropy, zero temperature, zero curvature, infinite positive specific heat and infinite scrambling time. Nonzero value of the cosmological constant in the triple-horizon spacetime is tightly fixed by quantum dynamics of evaporation of the cosmological horizon.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Magnetized dark energy and the late time acceleration	10.1140/epjp/i2012-12127-6	In the present work we have searched the existence of the late time acceleration of the Universe. The matter source that is responsible for the late time acceleration of the Universe consists of cosmic fluid with the equation of state parameter omega = p/rho and uniform magnetic field of energy density rho B. The study is done here under the framework of spatially homogeneous and anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi-I cosmological model in the presence of magnetized dark energy. To get the deterministic model of the Universe, we assume that the shear scalar (sigma) in the model is proportional to expansion scalar (theta). This condition leads to A = B-n, where A and B are metric functions and n is a positive constant giving the proportionality condition between shear and expansion scalar. It has been found that the isotropic distribution of magnetized dark energy leads to the present accelerated expansion of the Universe and the derived model is in good agreement with the recent astrophysical observations. The physical behavior of the Universe has been discussed in details.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
Bianchi type V viscous fluid cosmological models in presence of decaying vacuum energy	10.1007/s10509-012-1134-2	Bianchi type V viscous fluid cosmological model for barotropic fluid distribution with varying cosmological term I > is investigated. We have examined a cosmological scenario proposing a variation law for Hubble parameter H in the background of homogeneous, anisotropic Bianchi type V space-time. The model isotropizes asymptotically and the presence of shear viscosity accelerates the isotropization. The model describes a unified expansion history of the universe indicating initial decelerating expansion and late time accelerating phase. Cosmological consequences of the model are also discussed.

Geometrical origin of the cosmological constant	10.1007/s10714-012-1413-9	We show that the description of the space-time of general relativity as a diagonal four dimensional submanifold immersed in an eight dimensional hypercomplex manifold, in torsionless case, leads to a geometrical origin of the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant appears naturally in the new field equations and its expression is given as the norm of a four-vector U, i.e., I > = 6g (mu nu) U (mu) U (nu) and where U can be determined from the Bianchi identities. Consequently, the cosmological constant is space-time dependent, a Lorentz invariant scalar, and may be positive, negative or null. The resulting energy momentum tensor of the dark energy depends on the cosmological constant and its first derivative with respect to the metric. As an application, we obtain the spherical solution for the field equations. In cosmology, the modified Friedmann equations are proposed and a condition on I > for an accelerating universe is deduced. For a particular case of the vector U, we find a decaying cosmological constant .	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
A cosmological concordance model with dynamical vacuum term	10.1016/j.physletb.2012.08.014	We demonstrate that creation of dark-matter particles at a constant rate implies the existence of a cosmological term that decays linearly with the Hubble rate. We discuss the cosmological model that arises in this context and test it against observations of the first acoustic peak in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum, the Hubble diagram for supernovas of type la (SNIa), the distance scale of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the distribution of large scale structures (LSS). We show that a good concordance is obtained, albeit with a higher value of the present matter abundance than in the ACDM model. We also comment on general features of the CMB anisotropy spectrum and on the cosmic coincidence problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
ISSUES WITH VACUUM ENERGY AS THE ORIGIN OF DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0217732312501544	In this paper, we address some of the issues raised in the literature about the conflict between a large vacuum energy density, a priori predicted by quantum field theory, and the observed dark energy which must be the energy of vacuum or include it. We present a number of arguments against this claim and in favor of a null vacuum energy. They are based on the following arguments: A new definition for the vacuum in quantum field theory as a frame-independent coherent state; results from a detailed study of condensation of scalar fields in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background performed in a previous work; and our present knowledge about the Standard Model of particle physics. One of the predictions of these arguments is the confinement of nonzero expectation value of Higgs field to scales roughly comparable with the width of electroweak gauge bosons or shorter. If the observation of Higgs by the LHC is confirmed, accumulation of relevant events and their energy dependence in near future should allow us to measure the spatial extend of the Higgs condensate.

Conformal invariance, dark energy, and CMB non-gaussianity	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/09/024	In addition to simple scale invariance, a universe dominated by dark energy naturally gives rise to correlation functions possessing full conformal invariance. This is due to the mathematical isomorphism between the conformal group of certain three dimensional slices of de Sitter space and the de Sitter isometry group SO(4; 1). In the standard homogeneous, isotropic cosmological model in which primordial density perturbations are generated during a long vacuum energy dominated de Sitter phase, the embedding of flat spatial R-3 sections in de Sitter space induces a conformal invariant perturbation spectrum and definite prediction for the shape of the non-Gaussian CMB bispectrum. In the case in which the density fluctuations are generated instead on the de Sitter horizon, conformal invariance of the S-2 horizon embedding implies a different but also quite definite prediction for the angular correlations of CMB non-Gaussianity on the sky. Each of these forms for the bispectrum is intrinsic to the symmetries of de Sitter space, and in that sense, independent of specific model assumptions. Each is different from the predictions of single field slow roll inflation models, which rely on the breaking of de Sitter invariance. We propose a quantum origin for the CMB fluctuations in the scalar gravitational sector from the conformal anomaly that could give rise to these non-Gaussianities without a slow roll inflaton field, and argue that conformal invariance also leads to the expectation for the relation n(S) - 1 = n(T) between the spectral indices of the scalar and tensor power spectrum. Confirmation of this prediction or detection of non-Gaussian correlations in the CMB of one of the bispectral shape functions predicted by conformal invariance can be used both to establish the physical origins of primordial density fluctuations, and distinguish between different dynamical models of cosmological vacuum dark energy.

Black hole formation with an interacting vacuum energy density	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043012	We discuss the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric massive core of a star in which the fluid component is interacting with a growing vacuum energy density. The influence of the variable vacuum in the collapsing core is quantified by a phenomenological beta parameter as predicted by dimensional arguments and the renormalization group approach. For all reasonable values of this free parameter, we find that the vacuum energy density increases the collapsing time, but it cannot prevent the formation of a singular point. However, the nature of the singularity depends on the value of beta. In the radiation case, a trapped surface is formed for beta <= 1/2, whereas for beta >= 1/2, a naked singularity is developed. In general, the critical value is beta = 1-2/3(1 + omega) where omega is the parameter describing the equation of state of the fluid component.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Contact term, its holographic description in QCD and dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.045026	In this work we study the well-known contact term, which is the key element in resolving the so-called U(1)(A) problem in QCD. We study this term using the dual holographic description. We argue that in the dual picture the contact term is saturated by the D2-branes which can be interpreted as the tunneling events in Minkowski space-time. We quote a number of direct lattice results supporting this identification. We also argue that the contact term receives a Casimir-like correction similar to(Lambda R-QCD)(-1) rather than the naively expected expd(-Lambda R-QCD) when the Minkowski space-time R-3,R-1 is replaced by a large but finite manifold with a size R. Such a behavior is consistent with other quantum field theory (QFT)-based computations when powerlike corrections are due to nontrivial properties of topological sectors of the theory. In holographic description, such a behavior is due to a massless Ramond-Ramond (RR) field living in the bulk of multidimensional space when powerlike corrections is a natural outcome of a massless RR field. In many respects, the phenomenon is similar to the Aharonov-Casher effect when the ``modular electric field{''} can penetrate into a superconductor where the electric field is exponentially screened. The role of ``modular operator{''} from the Aharonov-Casher effect is played by a large-gauge transformation operator T in four-dimensional QCD, resulting in the transparency of the system to topologically nontrivial pure gauge configurations. We discuss some profound consequences of our findings. In particular, we speculate that a slow variation of the contact term in expanding universe might be the main source of the observed dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

Generalizing the running vacuum energy model and comparing with the entropic-force models	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.043010	We generalize the previously proposed running vacuum energy model by including a term proportional to H, in addition to the existing H-2 term. We show that the added degree of freedom is very constrained if both low redshift and high redshift data are taken into account. Best-fit models are undistinguishable from Delta CDM at the present time, but could be distinguished in the future with very accurate data at both low and high redshifts. We stress the formal analogy at the phenomenological level of the running vacuum models with recently proposed dark energy models based on the holographic or entropic point of view, where a combination of H and H-2 term is also present. However those particular entropic formulations which do not have a constant term in the Friedmann equations are not viable. The presence of this term is necessary in order to allow for a transition from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion. In contrast, the running vacuum models, both the original and the generalized one introduced here contain this constant term in a more natural way. Finally, important conceptual issues common to all these models are emphasized.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Designing dark energy afterglow experiments	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.035006	Chameleon fields, which are scalar field dark energy candidates, can evade fifth force constraints by becoming massive in high-density regions. However, this property allows chameleon particles to be trapped inside a vacuum chamber with dense walls. Afterglow experiments constrain photon-coupled chameleon fields by attempting to produce and trap chameleon particles inside such a vacuum chamber, from which they will emit an afterglow as they regenerate photons. Here we discuss several theoretical and systematic effects underlying the design and analysis of the GammeV and CHASE afterglow experiments. We consider chameleon particle interactions with photons, Fermions, and other chameleon particles, as well as with macroscopic magnetic fields and matter. The afterglow signal in each experiment is predicted, and its sensitivity to various properties of the experimental apparatus is studied. Finally, we use CHASE data to exclude a wide range of photon-coupled chameleon dark energy models.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Jacobi stability analysis of dynamical systems-applications in gravitation and cosmology		The Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) theory represents a powerful mathematical method for the analysis of dynamical systems. In this approach, one describes the evolution of a dynamical system in geometric terms, by considering it as a geodesic in a Finsler space. By associating a non-linear connection and a Berwald-type connection to the dynamical system, five geometrical invariants are obtained, with the second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the system. The Jacobi (in)stability is a natural generalization of the (in)stability of the geodesic flow on a differentiable manifold endowed with a metric (Riemannian or Finslerian) to the non-metric setting. In the present paper, we review the basic mathematical formalism of the KCC theory, and present some specific applications of this method in general relativity, cosmology and astrophysics. In particular, we investigate the Jacobi stability of the general relativistic static fluid sphere with a linear barotropic equation of state, of the vacuum in the brane world models, of a dynamical dark energy model, and of the Lane-Emden equation, respectively. It is shown that the Jacobi stability analysis offers a powerful and simple method for constraining the physical properties of different systems, described by second-order differential equations.

Qualitative study of perfect-fluid Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models with a cosmological constant	10.1119/1.4731258	The evolution of spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models containing a perfect fluid with equation of state p = w rho and a cosmological constant Lambda is investigated for arbitrary combinations of w and Lambda, using standard qualitative analysis borrowed from classical mechanics. This approach allows one to consider a large variety of situations, appreciating similarities and differences between models, without solving the Friedmann equation, and is suitable for an elementary course in cosmology.

Cosmological evolution of interacting new holographic dark energy in non-flat universe	10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2097-8	We consider the interacting holographic dark energy with new infrared cutoff (involving Hubble parameter and its derivative) in a non-flat universe. In this context, we obtain the equation of state parameter which evolutes the universe from the vacuum dark energy region towards the quintessence region for particular values of constant parameters. It is found that this model always remains unstable against small perturbations. Further, we establish the correspondence of this model having quintessential behavior with quintessence, tachyon, K-essence and dilaton scalar-field models. The dynamics of scalar fields and potentials indicate accelerated expansion of the universe, which is consistent with the current observations. Finally, we discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics in this scenario.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Theoretical prediction of cosmological constant I > in Veneziano ghost theory of QCD	10.1007/s11467-012-0265-9	Based on the Veneziano ghost theory of QCD, we predict the cosmological constant D >, which is related to energy density of cosmological vacuum by . In the Veneziano ghost theory, the vacuum energy density rho (D >) is expressed by absolute value of the product of quark vacuum condensate and quark current mass: . We calculate the quark local vacuum condensates aOE (c) 0|: q: |0 > by solving Dyson-Schwinger Equations for a fully dressed confining quark propagator S (f) (p) with an effective gluon propagator G (A mu nu) (ab) (q). The quark current mass m (q) is predicted by use of chiral perturbation theory. Our theoretical result of D >, with the resulting aOE (c) 0|: 471-4 q: |0 > = -(235 MeV)(3) and light quark current mass m (q) a parts per thousand integral 3.29-6.15 MeV, is in a good agreement with the observable of the D > a parts per thousand 10(-52) m(-2) used widely in a great amount of literatures.

Inhomogeneous vacuum energy	10.1088/0264-9381/29/14/145017	Vacuum energy remains the simplest model of dark energy which could drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe without necessarily introducing any new degrees of freedom. Inhomogeneous vacuum energy is necessarily interacting in general relativity. Although the 4-velocity of vacuum energy is undefined, an interacting vacuum has an energy transfer and the vacuum energy defines a particular foliation of spacetime. In particular we will discuss cosmological solutions where the background vacuum energy is spatially homogeneous. It is possible to give a consistent description of vacuum dynamics and in particular the relativistic equations of motion for spatially inhomogeneous perturbations given a covariant prescription for the vacuum energy, or equivalently the energy transfer 4-vector, and we construct gauge-invariant vacuum perturbations. We show that any dark energy cosmology can be decomposed into an interacting vacuum+matter cosmology whose inhomogeneous perturbations obey simple first-order equations.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Local P violation effects and thermalization in QCD: Views from quantum field theory and holography	10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2012.05.003	We argue that the local violation of P and CP invariance in heavy ion collisions and the universal thermal aspects observed in high energy collisions are in fact two sides of the same coin, and both are related to quantum anomalies of QCD. We argue that the low energy relations representing the quantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low-dimensional vacuum configurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum and approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of colliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission results from the distortion of these low-dimensional vacuum sheets rather than from the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long-range correlations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for explanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the same distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations. We formulate the corresponding physics using the effective low energy effective Lagrangian. We also formulate the same physics in terms of the dual holographic picture when low-dimensional sheets of topological charge embedded in 4d space, as observed in Monte Carlo simulations, are identified with D2 branes. Finally, we argue that study of these long-range correlations in heavy ion collisions could serve as a perfect test of a proposal that the observed dark energy in present epoch is a result of a tiny deviation of the QCD vacuum energy in expanding universe from its conventional value in Minkowski space-time.

Electroweak instantons, axions, and the cosmological constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2012.05.057	If there is explicit violation of baryon plus lepton number at some energy scale, then the electroweak theory depends upon a theta-angle. Due to a singular integration over small scale size instantons, this theta-dependence is sensitive to very high momentum scales. Assuming that there is no new physics between the electroweak and Planck scales, for an electroweak axion the energy difference between the vacuum at theta not equal 0, and that at theta = 0, is of the correct order of magnitude to be the dark energy observed in the present epoch.

More on QCD ghost dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.023511	The difference between the vacuum energy of quantum fields in Minkowski space and in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe might be related to the observed dark energy. The vacuum energy of the Veneziano ghost field introduced to solve the U(1)(A) problem in QCD is of the form H + O(H-2). Based on this, we study the dynamical evolution of a phenomenological dark energy model whose energy density is of the form alpha H + beta H-2. In this model, the universe approaches a de Sitter phase at late times. We fit the model with current observational data, including SnIa, BAO, CMB, BBN, the Hubble parameter, and the growth rate of matter perturbation. It shows that the universe begins to accelerate at redshift z similar to 0.75, and this model is consistent with current data. In particular, this model fits the data of the growth factor well as the Lambda CDM model.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Spontaneous symmetry breaking in inflationary cosmology: On the fate of Goldstone bosons	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.023509	We argue that in an inflationary cosmology a consequence of the lack of time translational invariance is that spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry and Goldstone's theorem do not imply the existence of massless Goldstone modes. We study spontaneous symmetry breaking in an O(2) model, and implications for O(N) in de Sitter space-time. The Goldstone mode acquires a radiatively generated mass as a consequence of infrared divergences, and the continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken for any finite N; however there is a first order phase transition as a function of the Hawking temperature T-H = H/2 pi. For O(2) the symmetry is spontaneously broken for T-H < T-c = lambda(1/4)nu/2.419 where lambda is the quartic coupling and nu is the tree-level vacuum expectation value and the Goldstone mode acquires a radiatively generated mass M-pi(2) proportional to lambda H-1/4. The first order nature of the transition is a consequence of the strong infrared behavior of minimally coupled scalar fields in de Sitter space-time; the jump in the order parameter at T-H = T-c is sigma(0c) similar or equal to 0.6/H lambda(1/4). In the strict N -> infinity the symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. Furthermore, the lack of kinematic thresholds imply that the Goldstone modes decay into Goldstone and Higgs modes by emission and absorption of superhorizon quanta.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Entanglement entropy of an accelerating universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.86.027501	We have considered the existence of a dependence of the entanglement entropy on the cosmological horizon surface area also in several accelerating models of the current universe both for a quintessence scalar field and for a phantom-energy scenario. It is shown that if a quintessence vacuum cosmic field is considered then, though the case for w > -1 satisfies a second law for entanglement entropy, when w < -1 such a law is violated. It is finally noted that the entanglement entropy and the distinct formulations of cosmic holography share common future surfaces which are optimal screen for the latter descriptions.

Everything you always wanted to know about the cosmological constant problem (but were afraid to ask)	10.1016/j.crhy.2012.04.008	This article aims at discussing the cosmological constant problem at a pedagogical but fully technical level. We review how the vacuum energy can be regularized in flat and curved space-time and how it can be understood in terms of Feynman bubble diagrams. In particular, we show that the properly renormalized value of the zero-point energy density today (for a free theory) is in fact far from being 122 orders of magnitude larger than the critical energy density, as often quoted in the literature. We mainly consider the case of scalar fields but also treat the cases of fermions and gauge bosons which allows us to discuss the question of vacuum energy in super-symmetry. Then, we discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar system or atomic spectra. We also review why the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect seem to indicate that the quantum zero-point fluctuations are not an artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of vacuum energy and we discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics, in particular the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment and the quantum Galileo experiment performed with a Salecker-Wigner-Peres clock. Finally, we briefly conclude with a discussion on the solutions to the cosmological constant problem that have been proposed so far.

Constraining dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/07/048	In this paper we propose a mechanism that protects theories violating a holographic bound suggested in arXiv:1203.5476 from developing accelerated expansion. The mechanism builts on work on transplanckian physics, and a non-trivial choice of vacuum states. If correct, it lends further support for detectable signatures in the CMBR signalling new physics.

Holographic Lambda(t)CDM model in a non-flat universe	10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2077-z	The holographic Lambda(t)CDM model in a non-flat universe is studied in this paper. In this model, to keep the form of the stress-energy of the vacuum required by general covariance, the holographic vacuum is enforced to exchange energy with dark matter. It is demonstrated that for the holographic model the best choice for the IR cutoff of the effective quantum field theory is the event horizon size of the universe. We derive the evolution equations of the holographic Lambda(t)CDM model in a non-flat universe. We constrain the model by using the current observational data, including the 557 Union2 type Ia supernovae data, the cosmic microwave background anisotropy data from the 7-yr WMAP, and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the SDSS. Our fit results show that the holographic Lambda(t)CDM model tends to favor a spatially closed universe (the best-fit value of Omega(k0) is -0.042), and the 95 \% confidence level range for the spatial curvature is -0.101 < Omega(k0) < 0.040. We show that the interaction between the holographic vacuum and dark matter induces an energy flow of which the direction is first from vacuum to dark matter and then from dark matter to vacuum. Thus, the holographic Lambda(t)CDM model is just a time-varying vacuum energy scenario in which the interaction between vacuum and dark matter changes sign during the expansion of the universe.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking vacuum energy in cosmology	10.1088/1674-1056/21/7/079801	The gravitational effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking vacuum energy density is investigated by subtracting the flat space-time contribution from the energy in the curved space-time. We find that the remaining effective energy-momentum tensor is too small to cause the acceleration of the universe, although it satisfies the characteristics of dark energy. However, it could provide a promising explanation to the puzzle of why the gravitational effect produced by the huge symmetry breaking vacuum energy in the electroweak theory has not been observed, as it has a sufficiently small value (smaller than the observed cosmic energy density by a factor of 10(32)).

The Casimir Effect and the Vacuum Energy: Duality in the Physical Interpretation	10.1007/s00601-011-0250-9	The Casimir effect is usually interpreted as arising from the modification of the zero point energy of QED when two perfectly conducting plates are put very close to each other, and as a proof of the ``reality{''} of this zero point energy. The Dark Energy, necessary to explain the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe is sometimes viewed as another proof of the same reality. Recently, several physicists have challenged the usual interpretation, arguing that the Casimir effect should rather be considered as a ``giant{''} van der Waals effect. All these aspects are shortly reviewed.	FEW-BODY SYSTEMS
Nonsingular Brans- Dicke-Lambda cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.124059	We discuss a Brans-Dicke model with a cosmological constant, a negative value of the w parameter, and an arbitrary (in general nonvanishing) scale factor at the big bang. The Friedmann equations for a flat universe are considered. The current observational values for Hubble constant H-0 and deceleration parameter q(0) play the role of initial conditions. We follow the approach of Uehara and Kim in order to solve field equations analytically. In K. Uehara and C. W. Kim [Phys. Rev. D 26, 2575 (1982)] only positive values of w were considered; we extend the study to a complete set of possible w values. Our main result is that the scale factor (during its evolution back in time direction) may not vanish, unlike in the standard Lambda CDM case. In other words, the considered model demonstrates a cosmological bounce instead of the initial singularity. The famous formula (24), that leads to the bounce, is valid only for the dust-filled universe with p = 0 and, therefore, is not adequate for the early universe hot stage when the bounce happens. So, our results are qualitative in nature and must be used to obtain initial values for the hot stage of the Universe.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Condensates and quasiparticles in inflationary cosmology: Mass generation and decay widths	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.123525	During de Sitter inflation massless particles of minimally coupled scalar fields acquire a mass and a decay width thereby becoming quasiparticles. For bare massless particles nonperturbative infrared radiative corrections lead to a self-consistent generation of mass, for a quartic self-interaction M proportional to lambda(1/4) H, and for a cubic self-interaction the mass is induced by the formation of a nonperturbative condensate leading to M proportional to lambda H-1/3(2/3). These radiatively generated masses restore de Sitter invariance and result in anomalous scaling dimensions of superhorizon fluctuations. We introduce a generalization of the nonperturbativeWigner-Weisskopf method to obtain the time evolution of quantum states that include the self-consistent generation of mass and regulate the infrared behavior. The infrared divergences are manifest as poles in Delta = M-2/3H(2) in the single particle self-energies, leading to a rearrangement of the perturbative series nonanalytic in the couplings. A set of simple rules that yield the leading order infrared contributions to the decay width are obtained and implemented. The lack of kinematic thresholds entail that all particle states acquire a decay width, dominated by the emission and absorption of superhorizon quanta proportional to (lambda/H)(4/3)[H/k(ph)(eta)](6); lambda[H/k(ph)(eta)](6) for cubic and quartic couplings respectively to leading order in M / H. The decay of single particle quantum states hastens as their wave vectors cross the Hubble radius and their width is related to the highly squeezed limit of the bi- or trispectrum of scalar fluctuations respectively.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Zero-point quantum fluctuations in cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.124031	We reexamine the classic problem of the renormalization of zero-point quantum fluctuations in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. We discuss a number of issues that arise when regularizing the theory with a momentum-space cutoff, and show explicitly how introducing noncovariant counterterms allows to obtain covariant results for the renormalized vacuum energy-momentum tensor. We clarify some confusion in the literature concerning the equation of state of vacuum fluctuations. Further, we point out that the general structure of the effective action becomes richer if the theory contains a scalar field phi with mass m smaller than the Hubble parameter H(t). Such an ultralight particle cannot be integrated out completely to get the effective action. Apart from the volume term and the Einstein-Hilbert term, that are reabsorbed into renormalizations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant, the effective action in general also has a term proportional to F(phi)R, for some function F(phi). As a result, vacuum fluctuations of ultralight scalar fields naturally lead to models where the dark energy density has the form rho(DE)(t) = rho(X)(t) + rho(Z)(t), where rho(X) is the component that accelerates the Hubble expansion at late times and rho(Z)(t) is an extra contribution proportional to H-2(t). We perform a detailed comparison of such models with CMB, SNIa and BAO data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

Spherical symmetry in a dark energy permeated spacetime	10.1088/0264-9381/29/11/115003	The properties of a spherically symmetric static spacetime permeated through dark energy are worked out. Dark energy is viewed as the strain energy of an elastically deformable four-dimensional manifold. The metric is worked out in the vacuum region around a central spherical mass/defect in the linear approximation. We discuss analogies and differences with the analogue in the de Sitter spacetime and how these competing scenarios could be differentiated on an observational ground. The comparison with the tests at the solar system scale puts upper limits to the parameters of the theory, consistent with the values obtained applying the classical cosmological tests.

Constraints on Lambda(t)-cosmology with power law interacting dark sectors	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/06/039	Motivated by the cosmological constant and the coincidence problems, we consider a cosmological model where the cosmological constant Lambda(0) is replaced by a cosmological term Lambda(t) which is allowed to vary in time. More specifically, we are considering that this dark energy term interacts with dark matter through the phenomenological decay law (rho)over dot(Lambda) = -Q rho(n)(Lambda). We have constrained the model for the range n is an element of [0, 10] using various observational data (SNeIa, GRB, CMB, BAO, OHD), emphasizing the case where n = 3/2. This case is the only one where the late-time value for the ratio of dark energy density and matter energy density rho(Lambda)/rho(m) is constant, which could provide an interesting explanation to the coincidence problem. We obtain strong limits on the model parameters which however exclude the region where the coincidence or the cosmological constant problems are significantly ameliorated.

GHOST DARK ENERGY IN f(R) MODEL OF GRAVITY	10.1142/S0218271812500575	We study a correspondence between f(R) model of gravity in the Jordan frame and a phenomenological kind of dark energy (DE), which is known as QCD ghost DE. Since this kind of DE is not stable in the context of Einsteinian theory of gravity and Brans-Dicke model of gravity, we consider two kinds of correspondence between modified gravity and DE. By studding the dynamical evolution of model and finding relevant quantities such as, equation of state parameter, deceleration parameter, dimensionless density parameter, we show that the model can describe the present Universe and also the EoS parameter can cross the phantom divide line without needs to any kinetic energy with negative sign. Furthermore, by obtaining the adiabatic squared sound speed of the model for different cases of interaction, we show that this model is stable. Finally, we fit this model with supernova observational data in a noninteraction case and we find the best values of parameter at 1 sigma confidence interval as; f(0) = 0.958(-0.25)(+0.07), beta = -0, 256(-0.1)(+0.2) and Omega(m0) = 0.23(-0.15)(+0.3). These best-fit values show that DE equation of state parameter, omega(d0), can cross the phantom divide line at the present time.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
The vacuum component of the Universe (cosmological constant) should evolve	10.1134/S1063772912050010	The evolution of the vacuum component of the Universe is studied in both the quantum and classical regimes. Our Universe has emerged as a result of a tunneling process, beginning with an oscillating mode and passing on to a Friedmann mode, and it very probably had a high symmetry for the Planck parameters. In the first fractions of a second (the quantum regime), as it cooled, the vacuum component of the Universe lost its high degree of symmetry due to phase transitions; i.e., its positive energy density was subject to negative contributions from quantum field condensates (by 78 orders of magnitude). After the last (quark-hadron) phase transition, the vacuum energy ``froze.{''} At this time (10(-6) s), the vacuum energy density can be calculated using the formula of Zel'dovich and substituting the mean values of the pseudo-Goldstone boson (pi-mesons) masses characterizing the chromodynamic vacuum. Chiral symmetrywas lost at that time. The dynamics of the equilibrium vacuum after its ``hardening{''} is considered using the holographic principle. During the next 4 x 10(17) s (the classical regime), the vacuum component of the Universe was reduced by 45 orders of magnitude due to the creation of new quantum states during its expansion. It is possible to solve the cosmological-constant problem using the holographic principle, since the 123 problematic orders of magnitude disappear in usual physical processes. The vacuum energy density is also calculated in the classical regime to a redshift of 10(11) using a ``cosmological calculator.{''}.	ASTRONOMY REPORTS

The influence of gravitational binding energy on cosmic expansion dynamics: new perspectives for cosmology	10.1007/s10509-012-1002-0	Confronted with microwave background observations by WMAP and with consternating supernova locations in the magnitude-redshift diagram modern cosmology feels enforced to call for cosmic vacuum energy as a necessary cosmological ingredient. Most often this vacuum energy is associated with Einstein's cosmological constant I > or with so-called ``dark energy{''}. A positive value of I > describes an inflationary action on cosmic dynamics which in view of recent cosmological data appears as an absolute need. In this article, however, we question the hypothesis of a constant vacuum energy density since not justifiable on physical grounds. Instead we show that gravitational binding energy of cosmic matter, connected with ongoing structure formation during cosmic expansion, acts similar to vacuum energy, since it reduces the effective gravitating proper mass density. Thus one may be encouraged to believe that actions of cosmic vacuum energy and gravitational binding energy concerning their cosmological effects are closely related to each other, perhaps in some respects even have identical phenomenologies. Based on results presented in this article we propose that the generally wanted action of vacuum energy on cosmic spacetime dynamics inevitably leads to a decay of vacuum energy density. Connected with this decay is a decrease of cosmic binding energy and the generation of new effective gravitating mass in the universe. If this all is adequately taken into account by the energy-momentum tensor of the GR field equations, one is then led to non-standard cosmologies which for the first time can guarantee the conservation of the total energy both in static and expanding universes. We describe the structuring of cosmic matter by a change in time of the 2-point correlation-function. We do show here that cosmic structure formation drives accelerated cosmic expansion and feigns the action of vacuum energy density.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Generic scenarios of the accelerating Universe	10.1007/s10509-012-1005-x	Recent astronomical observations strongly indicate that the current Universe is undergoing an accelerated phase of its expansion. If the Universe evolution is described by the FRW model then the acceleration should be driven by some perfect substance violating the strong energy condition. Hence the negative pressure is required for the explanation of acceleration. While different candidates for the fluid termed dark energy have been suggested, the positive cosmological constant seems to be the simplest candidate for dark energy description. However the Lambda term treated as a quantum vacuum energy has no simple physical interpretation because of the fine tuning problem. In this paper we characterize a certain class of evolutional scenario of the accelerating universe from the point of view genericity expressed in notion of structural stability. It is shown that in this class all evolutional scenarios with transient acceleration effect are not generic. Only the LCDM model with the acceleration phase following the deceleration phase is structurally stable. Because the cosmological models with transient acceleration appear in string theory we conclude that they are not generic.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Thermal properties of time machines	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.105026	Connections between universes through tunneling space-times could make the multiverse a physical entity able to be observed from our own single universe. In this paper we first study the thermal properties of the static Klein-bottle holes and then consider one of the potentially observable effects from wormholes, ringholes, and nonorientable tunnelings when they are converted into time machines connecting other universes with ours own, that is a randomly varying in space and time thermal radiation which, with an unpredictable cadence, randomly manifested to a far observer as a short, occasional pulse with very high intensity and fluence which would be made of black body phantom or ordinary radiation. We discuss the odds for these bursts of thermal radiation to be eventually observable.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cycles in the multiverse	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.103509	Eternal inflation is a seemingly generic consequence of theories that give rise to accelerated expansion of the universe and possess multiple vacuum states. Making predictions in an eternally inflating universe is notoriously difficult because one must compare infinite quantities, and a wide variety of regulating procedures yield radically different results. This is the measure problem of eternal inflation. In this paper, we analyze models of eternal inflation which allow for the possibility of cyclic bubble universes: in each bubble, standard cosmological evolution is replayed over and over again. Eternal inflation can generically arise in cyclic models that include a dark energy dominated phase. In such models, several problematic consequences of certain regulating procedures, such as the youngness and Boltzmann brain problems, are substantially alleviated. We discuss the implications for making predictions in cyclic models, as well as some general implications for understanding the measure problem in eternal inflation.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Multihorizon spherically symmetric spacetimes with several scales of vacuum energy	10.1088/0264-9381/29/9/095025	We present a family of spherically symmetric multihorizon spacetimes with a vacuum dark fluid, associated with a time-dependent and spatially inhomogeneous cosmological term. The vacuum dark fluid is defined in a model-independent way by the symmetry of its stress-energy tensor, i.e. its invariance under Lorentz boosts in a distinguished spatial direction (p(r) = -rho for the spherically symmetric fluid), which makes dark fluid essentially anisotropic and allows its density to evolve. The related cosmological models belong to the Lemaitre class of models with anisotropic fluids and describe evolution of a universe with several scales of vacuum energy related to phase transitions during its evolution. The typical behavior of solutions and the number of spacetime horizons are determined by the number of vacuum scales. We study in detail the model with three vacuum scales: GUT, QCD and that responsible for the present accelerated expansion. The model parameters are fixed by the observational data and by conditions of analyticity and causality. We find that our Universe has three horizons. During the first inflation, the Universe enters a T-region, which makes expansion irreversible. After second phase transition at the QCD scale, the Universe enters R-region, where for a long time its geometry remains almost pseudo-Euclidean. After crossing the third horizon related to the present vacuum density, the Universe should have to enter the next T-region with the inevitable expansion.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Preludes to dark energy: zero-point energy and vacuum speculations	10.1007/s00407-011-0092-3	According to modern physics and cosmology, the universe expands at an increasing rate as the result of a ``dark energy{''} that characterizes empty space. Although dark energy is a modern concept, some elements in it can be traced back to the early part of the twentieth century. I examine the origin of the idea of zero-point energy, and in particular how it appeared in a cosmological context in a hypothesis proposed by Walther Nernst in 1916. The hypothesis of a zero-point vacuum energy attracted some attention in the 1920s, but without attempts to relate it to the cosmological constant that was discussed by Georges Lemaitre in particular. Only in the late 1960s, was it recognized that there is a connection between the cosmological constant and the quantum vacuum. As seen in retrospect, many of the steps that eventually led to the insight of a kind of dark energy occurred isolated and uncoordinated.	ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES
Extended Birkhoff's theorem in f(T) gravity	10.1140/epjc/s10052-012-2002-5	f(T) theory, a generally modified teleparallel gravity, has been proposed as an alternative gravity model to account for the dark energy phenomena. Following our previous work [Xin-he Meng and Ying-bin Wang, Eur. Phys. J. (2011), arXiv:1107.0629v1], we prove that Birkhoff's theorem holds in a more general context, specifically with the off diagonal tetrad case, in this communication letter. Then, we discuss, respectively, the results of the external vacuum and internal gravitational field in the f(T) gravity framework, as well as the extended meaning of this theorem. We also investigate the validity of Birkhoff's theorem in the frame of f(T) gravity via a conformal transformation by regarding the Brans-Dicke-like scalar as effective matter, and study the equivalence between both Einstein frame and Jordan frame.

Dark energy from neutrinos and standard model Higgs potential	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2012.02.003	The dark energy density of the universe is obtained from the Higgs potential by introducing a Higgs-dependent neutrino mass. In the standard picture of electro-weak symmetry breaking the Higgs potential is V phi = (lambda/4)(phi(2) - v(2))(2) and the Higgs field rolls down to the minima at <phi > = upsilon = 246.2 GeV and the net vacuum energy is zero. Now if the neutrino mass is a function of the Higgs field, then the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs is determined by maximizing the total pressure of the Higgs self interaction and the neutrino fluid P-phi + P-v (m(phi))w.r.t phi. The new minima <phi > = upsilon + sigma(m) shifts from the standard Higgs vev upsilon by a small amount sigma(m). The total pressure of the Higgs-neutrino coupled fluid P phi (upsilon + sigma(m)) + P-v (upsilon + sigma(m)) = -rho(Lambda) appears as the dark energy density of the universe. The magnitude of the dark energy is thus determined by to the neutrino mass and the Higgs potential. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
A Cosmological Model with Static Extra Dimensions and Varying Cosmological Constant	10.1007/s10773-011-1009-2	A five dimensional cosmological model with FLRW type Kaluza-Klien metric has been investigated with static extra dimensions and varying cosmological constant. The field equations with static extra dimension are solved by considering the cosmological constant as a function of time for different cases. The effective pressure is considered as the difference of pressure corresponding to the extra dimension and the usual four dimensions. The conditions for acceleration of the universe are then discussed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Quantum vacuum and virtual gravitational dipoles: the solution to the dark energy problem?	10.1007/s10509-012-0992-y	The cosmological constant problem is the principal obstacle in the attempt to interpret dark energy as the quantum vacuum energy. We suggest that the obstacle can be removed, i.e. that the cosmological constant problem can be resolved by assuming that the virtual particles and antiparticles in the quantum vacuum have the gravitational charge of the opposite sign. The corresponding estimates of the cosmological constant, dark energy density and the equation of state for dark energy are in the intriguing agreement with the observed values in the present day Universe. However, our approach and the Standard Cosmology lead to very different predictions for the future of the Universe; the exponential growth of the scale factor, predicted by the Standard Cosmology, is suppressed in our model.

Tachyon reconstruction of ghost dark energy	10.1007/s10509-012-0977-x	Recently it has been argued that a possible source for the dark energy may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background. In this paper we establish a connection between interacting ghost dark energy and tachyon field. It is demonstrated that the evolution of the ghost dark energy dominated universe can be described completely by a single tachyon scalar field. The potential and the dynamics of the tachyon field are reconstructed according to the evolutionary behavior of ghost energy density.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
DARK ENERGY DENSITY IN MODELS WITH SPLIT SUPERSYMMETRY AND DEGENERATE VACUA	10.1142/S0217751X12500637	In N = 1 supergravity supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric Minkowski vacua originating in the hidden sector can be degenerate. In the supersymmetric phase in flat Minkowski space, nonperturbative supersymmetry breakdown may take place in the observable sector, inducing a nonzero and positive vacuum energy density. Assuming that such a supersymmetric phase and the phase in which we live are degenerate, we estimate the value of the cosmological constant. We argue that the observed value of the dark energy density can be reproduced in the split SUSY scenario of SUSY breaking if the SUSY breaking scale is of order of 10(10) GeV.

Rastall cosmology and the Lambda CDM model	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.084008	Rastall's theory is based on the nonconservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We show that, in this theory, if we introduce a two-fluid model, one component representing vacuum energy whereas the other pressureless matter (e.g. baryons plus cold dark matter), the cosmological scenario is the same as for the Lambda CDM model, both at background and linear perturbation levels, except for one aspect: now dark energy may cluster. We speculate that this can lead to a possibility of distinguishing the models at the nonlinear perturbation level.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
String cosmology in LRS Bianchi type-II dusty Universe with time-decaying vacuum energy density Lambda	10.1007/s12043-012-0258-9	A model of a cloud formed by massive strings is used as a source of LRS Bianchi type-II with time-decaying vacuum energy density Lambda. To construct string cosmological models, we have used he energy-momentum tensor for such strings as formulated by Letelier (1983). The high nonlinear field equations have been solved for two types of strings: (i) massive string and (ii) Nambu string. The expansion theta in the model is assumed to be proportional to the shear a. This condition leads to A = beta B-m, where A and B are the metric coefficients, in is a constant and beta is an integrating constant. Our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent with the recent observations of supernovae type-Ia. The physical and geometrical behaviour of these models are also discussed.

Dark energy and key physical parameters of clusters of galaxies	10.1007/s10509-011-0936-y	We study physics of clusters of galaxies embedded in the cosmic dark energy background. Under the assumption that dark energy is described by the cosmological constant, we show that the dynamical effects of dark energy are strong in clusters like the Virgo cluster. Specifically, the key physical parameters of the dark mater halos in clusters are determined by dark energy: (1) the halo cut-off radius is practically, if not exactly, equal to the zero-gravity radius at which the dark matter gravity is balanced by the dark energy antigravity; (2) the halo averaged density is equal to two densities of dark energy; (3) the halo edge (cut-off) density is the dark energy density with a numerical factor of the unity order slightly depending on the halo profile. The cluster gravitational potential well in which the particles of the dark halo (as well as galaxies and intracluster plasma) move is strongly affected by dark energy: the maximum of the potential is located at the zero-gravity radius of the cluster.

Entropic Corrections to Coulomb's Law	10.1007/s10773-011-0989-2	Two well-known quantum corrections to the area law have been introduced in the literatures, namely, logarithmic and power-law corrections. Logarithmic corrections, arises from loop quantum gravity due to thermal equilibrium fluctuations and quantum fluctuations, while, power-law correction appears in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon. Inspired by Verlinde's argument on the entropic force, and assuming the quantum corrected relation for the entropy, we propose the entropic origin for the Coulomb's law in this note. Also we investigate the Uehling potential as a radiative correction to Coulomb potential in 1-loop order and show that for some value of distance the entropic corrections of the Coulomb's law is compatible with the vacuum-polarization correction in QED. So, we derive modified Coulomb's law as well as the entropy corrected Poisson's equation which governing the evolution of the scalar potential phi. Our study further supports the unification of gravity and electromagnetic interactions based on the holographic principle.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS

Generic thin-shell gravastars	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/03/034	We construct generic spherically symmetric thin-shell gravastars by using the cut-and-paste procedure. We take considerable effort to make the analysis as general and unified as practicable; investigating both the internal physics of the transition layer and its interaction with ``external forces{''} arising due to interactions between the transition layer and the bulk spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss both the dynamic and static situations. In particular, we consider ``bounded excursion{''} dynamical configurations, and probe the stability of static configurations. For gravastars there is always a particularly compelling configuration in which the surface energy density is zero, while surface tension is nonzero.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Anisotropic Bianchi Type-I Model with a Varying Lambda Term	10.1088/0256-307X/29/3/030401	Einstein field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological constants are considered in the presence of a perfect fluid for a Bianchi type-I universe by assuming that the cosmological term is proportional to the Hubble parameter. The variation law for vacuum density was recently proposed by Schutzhold on the basis of quantum field estimation in a curved expanding background. The cosmological term tends asymptotically to a genuine cosmological constant and the model tends to a de Sitter universe. We obtain that the present universe is accelerating with a large fraction of cosmological density in the form of a cosmological term.	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
Vacuum solution of a linear red-shift based correction in f (R) gravity	10.1007/s10714-011-1304-5	In this paper we have considered a red-shift based linear correction in derivative of action in the context of vacuum f (R) gravity. Here we have found out that the linear correction may describe the late time acceleration which is appeared by SuperNovae Ia with no need of dark energy. Also we have calculated the asymptotic action for the desired correction. The value of all solutions may reduce to de' Sitter universe in the absence of correction term.

Dynamical system analysis of cosmologies with running cosmological constant from quantum Einstein gravity	10.1088/1367-2630/14/2/025008	We discuss a mechanism that induces a time-dependent vacuum energy on cosmological scales. It is based on the instability-induced renormalization triggered by the low-energy quantum fluctuations in a Universe with a positive cosmological constant. We use the dynamical systems approach to study the qualitative behavior of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies where the cosmological constant is dynamically evolving according with this nonperturbative scaling at low energies. It will be shown that it is possible to realize `two regimes' dark energy phases, where an unstable early phase of power-law evolution of the scale factor is followed by an accelerated expansion era at late times.

Oscillating universe in the DGP braneworld	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.043521	With a method in which the Friedmann equation is written in a form such that evolution of the scale factor can be treated as that of a particle in a potential, we classify all possible cosmic evolutions in the DGP braneworld scenario with the dark radiation term retained. By assuming that the energy component is pressureless matter, radiation or vacuum energy, respectively, we find that in the matter or vacuum energy dominated case, the scale factor has a minimum value a(0). In the matter dominated case, the big bang singularity can be avoided in some special circumstances, and there may exist an oscillating universe or a bouncing one. If the cosmic scale factor is in the oscillating region initially, the universe may undergo an oscillation. After a number of oscillations, it may evolve to the bounce point through quantum tunneling and then expand. However, if the universe contracts initially from an infinite scale, it can turn around and then expand forever. In the vacuum energy dominated case, there exists a stable Einstein static state to avoid the big bang singularity. However, in certain circumstances in the matter or vacuum energy dominated case, a new kind of singularity may occur at a(0) as a result of the discontinuity of the scale factor. In the radiation dominated case, the universe may originate from the big bang singularity, but a bouncing universe which avoids this singularity is also possible.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark matter and dark energy via nonperturbative (flavor) vacua	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.045020	A nonperturbative field theoretical approach to flavor physics (Blasone-Vitiello formalism) has been shown to imply a highly nontrivial vacuum state. Although still far from representing a satisfactory framework for a coherent and complete characterization of flavor states, in recent years the formalism has received attention for its possible implications at cosmological scales. In a previous work, we implemented the approach on a simple supersymmetric model (free Wess-Zumino), with flavor mixing, which was regarded as a model for free neutrinos and sneutrinos. The resulting effective vacuum (called flavor vacuum) was found to be characterized by a strong supersymmetry breaking. In this paper we explore the phenomenology of the model and we argue that the flavor vacuum is a consistent source for both dark energy (thanks to the bosonic sector of the model) and dark matter (via the fermionic one). Quite remarkably, besides the parameters connected with neutrino physics, in this model no other parameters have been introduced, possibly leading to a predictive theory of dark energy/matter. Despite its oversimplification, such a toy model already seems capable to shed some light on the observed energy hierarchy between neutrino physics, dark energy and dark matter. Furthermore, we move a step forth in the construction of a more realistic theory, by presenting a novel approach for calculating relevant quantities and hence extending some results to interactive theories, in a completely nonperturbative way.

QUANTUM THEORY AT PLANCK SCALE, LIMITING VALUES, DEFORMED GRAVITY AND DARK ENERGY PROBLEM	10.1142/S0218271812500137	Within a theory of the existing fundamental length on the order of Planck's, a high-energy deformation of the General Relativity for the space with horizon has been constructed. On this basis, Markov's work of the early eighties of the last century has been given a new interpretation to show that the heuristic model considered by him may be placed on a fundamental footing. The obtained results have been applied to solving of the dark energy problem, making it possible to frame the following hypothesis: a dynamic cosmological term is a measure of deviation from a thermodynamic identity (the first law of thermodynamics) of the high-energy (Planck's) deformation of Einstein equations for horizon spaces in their thermodynamic interpretation.

Vacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric field in curved background	10.1016/j.physletb.2011.12.025	We study a supersymmetric model in curved background spacetime. We calculate the effective action and the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor using a covariant regularization procedure. A soft supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy density and pressure. Assuming the presence of a cosmic fluid in addition to the vacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric field an effective equation of state is derived in a self-consistent approach at one loop order. The net effect of the vacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric fields in the leading adiabatic order is a renormalization of the Newton and cosmological constants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Bouncing models with a cosmological constant	10.1103/PhysRevD.85.023508	Bouncing models have been proposed by many authors as a completion of, or even as an alternative to, inflation for the description of the very early and dense Universe. However, most bouncing models contain a contracting phase from a very large and rarefied state, where dark energy might have had an important role as it has today in accelerating our large Universe. In that case, its presence can modify the initial conditions and evolution of cosmological perturbations, changing the known results already obtained in the literature concerning their amplitude and spectrum. In this paper, we assume the simplest and most appealing candidate for dark energy, the cosmological constant, and evaluate its influence on the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the contracting phase of a bouncing model, which also contains a scalar field with a potential allowing background solutions with pressure and energy density satisfying p = w epsilon, w being a constant. An initial adiabatic vacuum state can be set at the end of domination by the cosmological constant, and an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is obtained for w approximate to 0, which is the usual result for bouncing models. However, the presence of the cosmological constant induces oscillations and a running towards a tiny red-tilted spectrum for long-wavelength perturbations.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Sensitivity to dark energy candidates by searching for four-wave mixing of high-intensity lasers in the vacuum	10.1093/ptep/pts073	Theoretical challenges to understand dark matter and dark energy suggest the existence of low-mass and weakly coupling fields in the universe. The quasi-parallel photon-photon collision system (QPS) can provide chances to probe the resonant production of these light dark fields and the induced decay by the coherent nature of laser fields simultaneously. By focusing high-intensity lasers with different colors in the vacuum, new colors emerge as signatures of the interaction. Because four photons in the initial and final states interact via dark field exchange, this process is analogous to four-wave mixing in quantum optics, where the frequency sum and difference between the incident three waves generate the fourth wave with a new frequency via the nonlinear property of crystals. The interaction rate of the four-wave mixing process has cubic dependence on the intensity of each wave. Therefore, if high-intensity laser fields are given, the sensitivity to the feeble coupling of dark fields to photons rapidly increases over a wide mass range below the sub-eV level. Based on experimentally measurable photon energies and linear polarization states, we formulate a relation between the accessible mass-coupling domains and the high-intensity laser parameters, where the effects of the finite spectrum width of pulse lasers are taken into account. The expected sensitivity suggests that we have the potential to explore interactions at the super-Planckian coupling strength in the sub-eV mass range, if cutting-edge laser technologies are properly combined.

Integrating BigBOSS with the Mayall Telescope	10.1117/12.925497	BigBOSS is a proposed ground-based dark energy experiment to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of large scale structure. It consists of a fiber-fed multi-object spectrograph designed to be installed on the Mayall 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona. BigBOSS includes an optical corrector assembly and 5000-fiber-positioner focal plane assembly that replace the existing Mayall prime focus hardware. 40-meter long optical fiber bundles are routed from the focal plane, through the telescope declination and right ascension pivots, to spectrographs in the thermally insulated FTS Laboratory, immediately adjacent to the telescope. Each of the ten spectrographs includes three separate spectral bands. The FTS Laboratory also houses support electronics, cooling, and vacuum equipment. The prime focus assembly includes mounts for the existing Mayall f/8 secondary mirror to allow observations with Cassegrain instruments. We describe the major elements of the BigBOSS instrument, plans for integrating with the Telescope, and proposed modifications and additions to existing Mayall facilities.

Readout Electronics for Hyper Suprime-Cam	10.1016/j.phpro.2012.03.742	Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a 1 Giga pixel CCD camera for a wide-field galaxy survey at the Subaru 8-m Telescope. It will be mounted on the prime focus of the Subaru Telescope and is scheduled to receive its first light in 2012. The primary science is to conduct a weak lensing survey over similar to 2,000 square degrees. The HSC has a 1.5-degree-diameter field of view, 7 times larger than that of its predecessor Suprime-Cam. It consists of a large corrector lens system and a focal plane equipped with 116 pieces of 2k x 4k fully depleted CCDs. Combined with the superb image quality and large aperture of the Subaru telescope, the survey using HSC can cover a cosmological volume and reach the limiting magnitude of at least one magnitude fainter than the other surveys conducted using 4-m class telescopes. The readout electronics of the HSC consist of two parts: one is the analog front-end electronics (FEE) and the other is the digital back-end electronics (BEE). The FEE is placed in a vacuum dewar together with the CCDs, and processes the analog CCD signal into 16-bit digital data. The BEE is small and light enough to be integrated into the camera unit, and employs three links of Gigabit Ethernet to readout a 2.3-GByte single exposure within 10 seconds at fast readout operation. The readout noise from the electronics is smaller than that from CCDs. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. Selection and/or peer review under responsibility of the organizing committee for TIPP 11.

Proposed Dark Energy Experiment Using Fullerenes	10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.009	A dark energy experiment is proposed, based on the dark energy research funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science.

The experiment may be able to detect whether the dark energy spectrum has a frequency-cubed distribution, the spectrum cutoff, and if there are any resonances. Such an experiment may be able to explain why the observed dark energy density is 122 orders of magnitude less than the theoretical prediction (which assumes a frequency cubed distribution and a cutoff at the Planck mass of 22 micrograms). The experiment might lead to a method for extracting dark energy for terrestrial and space-based uses. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer for astronomical observations and development of wavelength standards	10.1117/12.981589	At the Institute for Astrophysics Goettingen (TAG), we are purchasing a high resolution Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS) for astronomical observations and development of calibration standards aiming at high wavelength precision. Astronomical spectrographs that work in the regime of very high resolution (resolving powers lambda/delta lambda >= 10(5)) now achieve unprecedented precision and stability. Precise line shifts can be investigated to conclude for an objects radial velocity relative to the observer. As a long-term scientific goal, the evolution of galaxy redshift due to dark energy can be monitored. Also, the detection of lower mass, down to Earth-like planets will become feasible. Here, M-dwarfs are promising objects where an orbiting exo-Earth can cause a wavelength shift large enough to be detected. Emitting mainly in the near infrared (NIR), these objects require novel calibration standards. Current schemes under consideration are gas cathode lamps (e.g. CN, UNe) and a highly stable Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) to act as a cost-efficient alternative to the laser frequency comb (LFC, [1]). In addition to experiments exploring novel wavelength calibration types, light will be fed from our telescopes at TAG. A Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) for solar observations and the 50 cm Cassegrain telescope allow to investigate stellar and spatially resolved light at our facilities.

The Mystery of the Dark Energy based on Energy Materials	10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.496.523	Recently the observations on the type Ia supernova has showed the accelerated expansion of the universe which can be used to illustrate by the ``dark energy{''}. In order to understand the accelerated expansion of the universe and the dark energy, people study them based on two aspects: theoretical mechanism and cosmology observation restrictions. The simplest and the most frequently used models of the dark energy are the vacuum energy, cosmic constant model and quintessence model etc. The measurement of the universe can be used to identify the properties of the dark energy. The anisotropy of the type la supernova and cosmic microwave background radiation are the methods which commonly used to detect the dark energy, other methods are weak lensing, X ray gas group, high red shift gamma-ray burst and so on.

Inflation driven by particle creation	10.1063/1.4756813	The creation of ultra-light dark particles in the late-time FLRW spacetime provides a cosmological model in accordance with precise observational tests. The matter creation backreaction implies in this context a vacuum energy density scaling linearly with the Hubble parameter H, which is consistent with the vacuum expectation value of the QCD condensate in a low-energy expanding spacetime. Both the cosmological constant and coincidence problems are alleviated in this scenario. We also explore the opposite, high energy limit of the particle creation process. We show that it leads to a non-singular primordial universe where an early inflationary era takes place, with natural reheating and exit. The generated primordial spectrum is scale invariant and, by supposing that inflation lasts for 60 e-folds, we obtain a scalar expectral index n approximate to 0.97.

Casimir Energy of the Universe and the Dark Energy Problem	10.1088/1742-6596/384/1/012028	We regard the Casimir energy of the universe as the main contribution to the cosmological constant. Using 5 dimensional models of the universe, the flat model and the warped one, we calculate Casimir energy. Introducing the new regularization, called sphere lattice regularization, we solve the divergence problem. The regularization utilizes the closed-string configuration. We consider 4 different approaches: 1) restriction of the integral region (Randall-Schwartz), 2) method of 1) using the minimal area surfaces, 3) introducing the weight function, 4) generalized path-integral. We claim the 5 dimensional field theories are quantized properly and all divergences are renormalized. At present, it is explicitly demonstrated in the numerical way, not in the analytical way. The renormalization-group function (beta-function) is explicitly obtained. The renormalization-group flow of the cosmological constant is concretely obtained.	7TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE DARK SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE (DSU 2011)

Covariant Accelerating Holography	10.1063/1.4734409	By using the Bousso geometrical covariant procedure we consider in this paper the holographic principle as applied to asymptotic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-times whose vacuum dark energy is due to the presence of a quintessential dark and phantom energy scalar field with constant equation of state. We have obtained the positions of the optimal screen for each case, deriving for them moreover expressions for the future event horizon and hence holographic dark energy models of the Li and Huang and Li types which are compared with the most consistent results derived from the covariant Bousso procedure. It is also seen that one of the two obtained holographic screens is placed on the big rip hypersurface in the phantom-energy case, both for the covariant holographic formalism and holographic phantom models. Consistency of fundamental theories is analyzed in the light of the largest physical regions allowed by the existence of a holographic screen in the future.

GRAVITY AS AN EMERGENT PHENOMENON: CONCEPTUAL ASPECTS	10.1063/1.4734416	I describe several conceptual aspects involved in a particular approach which treats gravity as an emergent phenomenon. These aspects are related to the features of classical gravitational theories which defy explanation within the conventional perspective. The alternative paradigm throws light on these features and could provide better insights into possible description of quantum structure of spacetime.

SUPERSYMMETRIC DARK ENZERGY		We study a noninteracting supersymmetric model in de Sitter spacetime. A soft supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero vacuum energy density. A short distance cut-off of the order of Planck length provides a matching between the vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant related to the de Sitter expansion parameter.

Limits on decaying dark energy density models from the CMB temperature-redshift relation	10.1088/1742-6596/354/1/012009	We discuss the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a variable dark energy model with density scaling as rho(x) proportional to (1 + z)(m), z being the redshift. These models lead to the creation/disruption of matter and radiation, which affect the cosmic evolution of both matter and radiation components in the Universe. In particular, we have studied the temperature-redshift relation of radiation, which has been constrained using a recent collection of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature measurements up to z similar to 3. We find that, within the uncertainties, the model is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant which does not exchange any particles with other components. Future observations, in particular measurements of CMB temperature at large redshift, will allow to give firmer bounds on the effective equation of state parameter w(eff) for such types of dark energy models.	3RD ITALIAN-PAKISTANI WORKSHOP ON RELATIVISTIC ASTROPHYSICS (IPWRA2011)
BIANCHI TYPE-III COSMOLOGICAL MODEL WITH VARIABLE G AND Lambda-TERM IN GENERAL RELATIVITY		Exact solution of Einstein's field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological ``constant{''} is obtained in presence of perfect fluid for Bianchi III space-time. To get the deterministic solution of the field equations the expansion theta, in the model, is considered as proportional to the eigen value sigma(2)(2) of the shear tensor sigma(j)(i) and also the fluid obeys the barotropic equation of state. The value of cosmological constant Lambda for the model is found to be small and positive which is supported by the results from recent supernovae Ia observations. Moreover, it is observed that due to the combined effect of time variable Lambda and G the universe evolved with deceleration as well as acceleration. The model shows that G varies with time as suggested earlier by Large Number Hypothesis proposed by Dirac. It has been found that all physical and geometric parameters of the model are in fair agreement of observational results. Some physical and geometric properties of the model are also discussed.

Zero Point Energy as Origin of Dark Energy and Dark Matter	10.1063/1.3701891	An attempt is made to explain dark energy and dark matter of the expanding universe in terms of the zero point vacuum energy. This analysis is mainly limited to later stages of an observable nearly flat universe. It is based on a revised formulation of the spectral distribution of the zero point energy, for an ensemble in a defined statistical equilibrium having finite total energy density. The steady and dynamic states are studied for a spherical cloud of zero point energy photons. The ``antigravitational{''} force due to its pressure gradient then represents dark energy, and its gravitational force due to the energy density represents dark matter. Four fundamental results come out of the theory. First, the lack of emitted radiation becomes reconcilable with the concepts of dark energy and dark matter. Second, the crucial coincidence problem of equal orders of magnitude of mass density and vacuum energy density cannot be explained by the cosmological constant, but is resolved by the present variable concepts which originate from the same photon gas balance. Third, the present approach becomes reconcilable with cosmical dimensions and with the radius of the observable universe. Fourth, the deduced acceleration of the expansion agrees with the observed one.	JOINT ITER-IAEA-ICTP ADVANCED WORKSHOP ON FUSION AND PLASMA PHYSICS
Cosmological perturbations and the growth rate of matter fluctuations		The observed structures in the Universe (galaxies, clusters and superclusters) are the results of gravitational instability. This instability amplifies perturbations, originally very small, to the nonlinear regime. In this paper we compare the growth rates of matter perturbations for several cosmological models. Generally, the presence of dark energy reduces the growth. The details depend on the specific features of the model, for example on the coupling with the dark-energy perturbations or on interactions in the dark sector of the Universe.

Confronting the relaxation mechanism for a large cosmological constant with observations	10.1088/1475-7516/2012/01/050	In order to deal with a large cosmological constant a relaxation mechanism based on modified gravity has been proposed recently. By virtue of this mechanism the effect of the vacuum energy density of a given quantum field/string theory (no matter how big is its initial value in the early universe) can be neutralized dynamically, i.e. without fine tuning, and hence a Big Bang-like evolution of the cosmos becomes possible. Remarkably, a large class \{F-m(n)\} of models of this kind, namely capable of dynamically adjusting the vacuum energy irrespective of its value and size, has been identified. In this paper, we carefully put them to the experimental test. By performing a joint likelihood analysis we confront these models with the most recent observational data on type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the high redshift data on the expansion rate, so as to determine which ones are the most favored by observations. We compare the optimal relaxation models F-m(n) found by this method with the standard or concordance Lambda CDM model, and find that some of these models may appear as almost indistinguishable from it. Interestingly enough, this shows that it is possible to construct viable solutions to the tough cosmological fine tuning problem with models that display the same basic phenomenological features as the concordance model.

Modified entropic gravitation in superconductors	10.1016/j.physc.2011.09.011	Verlinde recently developed a theoretical account of gravitation in terms of an entropic force. The central element in Verlinde's derivation is information and its relation with entropy through the holographic principle. The application of this approach to the case of superconductors requires to take into account that information associated with superconductor's quantum vacuum energy is not stored on Planck size surface elements, but in four volume cells with Planck-Einstein size. This has profound consequences on the type of gravitational force generated by the quantum vacuum condensate in superconductors, which is closely related with the cosmological repulsive acceleration responsible for the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Remarkably this new gravitational type force depends on the level of breaking of the weak equivalence principle for cooper pairs in a given superconducting material, which was previously derived by the author starting from similar principles. It is also shown that this new gravitational force can be interpreted as a surface force. The experimental detection of this new repulsive gravitational-type force appears to be challenging.

Sudden singularities survive massive quantum particle production	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.123518	We solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a massive, nonminimally coupled scalar field, with a conformal coupling, undergoing cosmological evolution from a radiation-dominated phase to a future sudden singularity. We show that, after regularization, the energy of the created particles is zero and the backreaction from quantum effects does not change the evolution of the Universe near the future singularity and cannot prevent the finite-time sudden singularity.

CMB temperature and matter power spectrum in a decay vacuum dark energy model	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.123004	In this paper, a decay vacuum model (rho) over bar (Lambda) = 3 sigma M(p)(2)H(0)H is revisited by detailed analysis of background evolution and perturbation equations. We show the imprints on CMB temperature and matter power spectrum from the effective coupling terms between dark sectors by comparing to the standard cosmological constant model and observational data points (WMAP7 and SDSS DR7). We find that the decay vacuum model can describe the expansion rate at late times as well as the standard cosmological constant model but it fails to simultaneously reproduce the observed CMB and matter power spectrum. Its generalization (rho) over bar (Lambda) = 3M(p)(2)(xi(1)H(0)H + xi(2)H(2)) is also discussed. Detailed analysis of the background evolution shows that the dimensionless parameter xi(2) would be zero to avoid the unnatural ``fine-tuning{''} and to keep the positivity of energy density of dark matter and dark energy in the early epoch.

Back-reaction and effective acceleration in generic LTB dust models	10.1088/0264-9381/28/23/235002	We provide a thorough examination of the conditions for the existence of back-reaction and an `effective' acceleration (in the context of Buchert's averaging formalism) in regular generic spherically symmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) dust models. By considering arbitrary spherical comoving domains, we verify rigorously the fulfillment of these conditions expressed in terms of suitable scalar variables that are evaluated at the boundary of every domain. Effective deceleration necessarily occurs in all domains in (a) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a FLRW background (b) the asymptotic time range of non-vacuum hyperbolic models (c) LTB self-similar solutions and (d) near a simultaneous big bang. Accelerating domains are proven to exist in the following scenarios: (i) central vacuum regions(ii) central (non-vacuum) density voids (iii) the intermediate radial range of models converging to a FLRW background (iv) the asymptotic radial range of models converging to a Minkowski vacuum and (v) domains near and or intersecting a non-simultaneous big bang. All these scenarios occur in hyperbolic models with negative averaged and local spatial curvature though scenarios (iv) and (v) are also possible in low density regions of a class of elliptic models in which the local spatial curvature is negative but its average is positive. Rough numerical estimates between -0.003 and -0.5 were found for the effective deceleration parameter. While the existence of accelerating domains cannot be ruled out in models converging to an Einstein-de Sitter background and in domains undergoing gravitational collapse the conditions for this are very restrictive. The results obtained may provide important theoretical clues on the effects of back-reaction and averaging in more general non-spherical models.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Notes on ghost dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.123501	We study a phenomenological dark energy model which is rooted in the Veneziano ghost of QCD. In this dark energy model, the energy density of dark energy is proportional to Hubble parameter and the proportional coefficient is of the order Lambda(3)(QCD), where Lambda QCD is the mass scale of QCD. The universe has a de Sitter phase at late time and begins to accelerate at redshift around z(acc) similar to 0.6. We fit this model and give the constraints on model parameters, with current observational data including Type Ia supernovea, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, big bang nucleosynthesis, and Hubble parameter data. We also study the cosmological evolution of the dark energy with interaction with cold dark matter.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Entropy, contact interaction with horizon, and dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.124008	We present some arguments suggesting that the mismatch between Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the entropy of entanglement for vector fields is due to the same gauge configurations that saturate the contact term in topological susceptibility in QCD. In both cases, the extra term with the ``wrong sign{''} is due to distinct topological sectors in gauge theories. This extra term has a nondispersive nature, cannot be restored from the conventional spectral function through dispersion relations, and cannot be associated with any physical propagating degrees of freedom. We make a few comments on some of the profound consequences of our findings. In particular, we speculate that the source of the observed dark energy may also be related to the same type of gauge configurations that are responsible for the mismatch between black hole entropy and the entropy of entanglement in the presence of a causal horizon.

COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT IN A QUANTUM FLUID MODEL	10.1142/S0218271811020470	Possible analogies between vacuum state and quantum fluid provide a model to study vacuum energy density induced by thermal corrections, spacetime curvature, boundary conditions and quantum back-reaction. We find that vacuum energy density in this quantum fluid model is not naturally of the order of the matter energy density. We show how higher-order corrections in quantum back-reaction can also contribute to vacuum energy density, and how the cosmological expansion is a manifestation of a universe out of mechanical equilibrium. This last fact implies that simple thermodynamic arguments are not enough to explain the cosmological constant problem because the calculation of the associated vacuum energy density requires first the knowledge of the underlying microscopic physics of vacuum.

A Cosmological exact solution of generalized Brans-Dicke theory with complex scalar field and its phenomenological implications	10.2478/s11534-011-0067-7	When the Brans-Dicke theory is formulated in terms of the Jordan scalar field phi, the amount of dark energy is related to the mass of this field. We investigate a solution which is relevant to the late universe. We show that if phi is taken to be a complex scalar field, then an exact solution to the vacuum equations requires that the Friedmann equation possesses both a constant term and one which is proportional to the inverse sixth power of the scale factor. Possible interpretations and phenomenological implications of this result are discussed.	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS

The cosmological constant filter without big bang singularity	10.1088/0264-9381/28/22/225019	In the recently proposed cosmological constant (CC) filter mechanism based on modified gravity in the Palatini formalism, gravity in the radiation, matter and late-time de Sitter eras is insensitive to energy sources with the equation of state -1. This implies that finite vacuum energy shifts from phase transitions are filtered out too. In this work, we investigate the CC filter model at very early times. We find that the initial big bang singularity is replaced by a cosmic bounce, where the matter energy density and the curvature are finite. In a certain case, this finiteness can be already observed on the algebraic level.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
A TERRESTRIAL SEARCH FOR DARK CONTENTS OF THE VACUUM, SUCH AS DARK ENERGY, USING ATOM INTERFEROMETRY	10.1142/S0217751X11054814	We describe the theory and first experimental work on our concept for searching on earth for the presence of dark contents of the vacuum (DCV) using atom interferometry. Specifically, we have in mind any DCV that has not yet been detected on a laboratory scale, but which might manifest itself as dark energy on the cosmological scale. The experimental method uses two atom interferometers to cancel the effect of earth's gravity and diverse noise sources. It depends upon two assumptions: first, that the DCV possesses some space inhomogeneity in density, and second that it exerts a sufficiently strong nongravitational force on matter. The motion of the apparatus through the DCV should then lead to an irregular variation in the detected matter-wave phase shift. We discuss the nature of this signal and note the problem of distinguishing it from instrumental noise. We also discuss the relation of our experiment to what might be learned by studying the noise in gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. The paper concludes with a projection that a future search of this nature might be carried out using an atom interferometer in an orbiting satellite. The laboratory apparatus is now being constructed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Symmetron cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.103521	The symmetron is a scalar field associated with the dark sector whose coupling to matter depends on the ambient matter density. The symmetron is decoupled and screened in regions of high density, thereby satisfying local constraints from tests of gravity, but couples with gravitational strength in regions of low density, such as the cosmos. In this paper we derive the cosmological expansion history in the presence of a symmetron field, tracking the evolution through the inflationary, radiation- and matter-dominated epochs, using a combination of analytical approximations and numerical integration. For a broad range of initial conditions at the onset of inflation, the scalar field reaches its symmetry-breaking vacuum by the present epoch, as assumed in the local analysis of spherically symmetric solutions and tests of gravity. For the simplest form of the potential, the energy scale is too small for the symmetron to act as dark energy, hence we must add a cosmological constant to drive late-time cosmic acceleration. We briefly discuss a class of generalized, nonrenormalizable potentials that can have a greater impact on the late-time cosmology, though cosmic acceleration requires a delicate tuning of parameters in this case.

CASTING LIGHT ON THE GHOST	10.1142/S0217732311036954	The infrared sector of QCD contains all the necessary ingredients, once laid onto a time-dependent, curved background, to cater for the much needed cosmological vacuum energy. This is achieved through the fields that describe the impact of the long-range interactions of QCD, the Veneziano ghost and its dipolar partner. Although technically extremely challenging, the physics is well understood and the estimated dark energy density is of the correct order of magnitude. In this brief review I will retrace the steps leading to two new cosmological applications of this model, namely the possibility of the generation of cosmic magnetic fields, and the unification of several observed polarization anomalies under the same roof.

Quintessence interacting dark energy and a scalar dark fluid from 5D vacuum	10.1088/0264-9381/28/21/215007	Considering a five-dimensional (5D) spacetime empty of matter, we develop a procedure from which an interacting scalar field and its potential are induced on our 4D spacetime by the 5D geometry. We use the procedure to derive a new 4D interacting quintessence scenario, where the quintessence field, its potential and the interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components have a geometrical origin. The mass of the interacting quintessence field depends on the extra dimension, thus giving more freedom to avoid conflicts with nucleosynthesis. Then, inspired from some scalar dark matter models, we extend the geometrical formalism to derive a novel 4D late-time cosmological scenario, where the whole dark sector of the universe (scalar dark matter plus dark energy) admits a unified description by a single geometrical scalar field.

On the stability of scalar-vacuum space-times	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1791-2	We study the stability of static, spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations with a scalar field as the source. We describe a general methodology of studying small radial perturbations of scalar-vacuum configurations with arbitrary potentials V(phi), and in particular space-times with throats (including wormholes), which are possible if the scalar is phantom. At such a throat, the effective potential for perturbations V-eff has a positive pole (a potential wall) that prevents a complete perturbation analysis. We show that, generically, (i) V-eff has precisely the form required for regularization by the known S-deformation method, and (ii) a solution with the regularized potential leads to regular scalar field and metric perturbations of the initial configuration. The well-known conformal mappings make these results also applicable to scalar-tensor and f (R) theories of gravity. As a particular example, we prove the instability of all static solutions with both normal and phantom scalars and V(phi) equivalent to 0 under spherical perturbations. We thus confirm the previous results on the unstable nature of anti-Fisher wormholes and Fisher's singular solution and prove the instability of other branches of these solutions including the anti-Fisher ``cold black holes.{''}	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
DARK ENERGY IN SOME INTEGRABLE AND NONINTEGRABLE FRW COSMOLOGICAL MODELS	10.1142/S0218271811020445	One of the greatest challenges in today's cosmology to determine the nature of dark energy, the sourse of the observed present acceleration of the universe. Besides the vacuum energy, various dark energy models have been suggested. The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime plays an important role in modern cosmology. In particular, the most popular models of dark energy work in the FRW spacetime. In this work, a new class of integrable FRW cosmological models is presented. These models induced by the well-known Painleve equations. Some nonintegrable FRW models are also considered. These last models are constructed with the help of Pinney, Schrodinger and hypergeometric equations. Scalar field description and two-dimensional generalizations of some cosmological models are presented. Finally some integrable and nonintegrable F(R) and F(G) gravity models are constructed.

Additionally, we study the cosmological evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic universe, which is governed by an algebraic and not a differential equation. We show that the universe admits solutions corresponding to acceleration at late cosmological epochs, without the need of fine-tuning the model-parameters or the initial conditions.

A MODEL OF A SIMPLE, BARYON-DOMINATED UNIVERSE THAT EXPANDS AT AN EVER-INCREASING RATE WITHOUT RELYING ON VACUUM ENERGY (Lambda)	10.1142/S0217732311036796	The prevailing view in modern cosmology is that the universe is comprised of immense quantities of exotic materials (i.e. Dark Matter and Dark Energy) that have yet to be positively identified. However, there is also a small group of scientists who believe that the answer to this dilemma is to be found in the modification of gravity (i.e. General Relativity). This short paper states that if we make the bold assumption that all objects/observers are comprised of sets of spacetime coordinates that change (albeit slowly) as the universe ages, then three puzzles that currently confront cosmologists, astronomers and astrophysicists can easily be answered using relatively simple calculations. The condition necessary to explore this possibility can be obtained if one postulates that relativistic gravitational potential lessens (in absolute magnitude) everywhere as the universe ages (n). That is, the spacetime metric g(mu nu) (x) -> g(mu nu) (x, n). If gravity behaves in this manner, then it can be shown that it is the causitive agent of indeterminism in nature.

Early dark energy from zero-point quantum fluctuations	10.1016/j.physletb.2011.09.010	We examine a cosmological model with a dark energy density of the form rho oE(t) = rho x(t)+ rho z(t), where rho x is the component that accelerates the Hubble expansion at late times and rho z(t) is an extra contribution proportional to H-2(t). This form of rho z(t) follows from the recent proposal that the contribution of zero-point fluctuations of quantum fields to the total energy density should be computed by subtracting the Minkowski-space result from that computed in the FRW space-time. We discuss theoretical arguments that support this subtraction. By definition, this eliminates the quartic divergence in the vacuum energy density responsible for the cosmological constant problem. We show that the remaining quadratic divergence can be reabsorbed into a redefinition of Newton's constant only under the assumption that del(mu) < 0 vertical bar T-mu nu vertical bar 0 > = 0, i.e. that the energy-momentum tensor of vacuum fluctuations is conserved in isolation. However in the presence of an ultra-light scalar field X with m(X) < H-0, as typical of some dark energy models, the gravity effective action depends both on the gravitational field and on the X field. In this case general covariance only requires del(mu)(T-mu nu(X) + < 0 vertical bar T-mu nu vertical bar 0 >). If there is an exchange of energy between these two terms, there are potentially observable consequences. We construct an explicit model with an interaction between rho x and rho z and we show that the total dark energy density rho(DE)(t) = rho x(t) + rho z(t) always remains a finite fraction of the critical density at any time, providing a specific model of early dark energy. We discuss the implication of this result for the coincidence problem and we estimate the model parameters by means of a full likelihood analysis using current CMB, SNe la and BAO data.

A parametrization of the growth index of matter perturbations in various Dark Energy models and observational prospects using a Euclid-like survey	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/10/010	We provide exact solutions to the cosmological matter perturbation equation in a homogeneous FLRW universe with a vacuum energy that can be parametrized by a constant equation of state parameter w and a very accurate approximation for the Ansatz w(a) = w(0) + w(a) (1 - a). We compute the growth index gamma = log f(a)/log Omega(m) (a), and its redshift dependence, using the exact and approximate solutions in terms of Legendre polynomials and show that it can be parametrized as gamma(a) = gamma(0) + gamma(a) (1 - a) in most cases. We then compare four different types of dark energy (DE) models: w Lambda CDM, DGP, f(R) and a LTB-large-void model, which have very different behaviors at z greater than or similar to 1. This allows us to study the possibility to differentiate between different DE alternatives using wide and deep surveys like Euclid, which will measure both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts for several hundreds of millions of galaxies up to redshift z similar or equal to 2. We do a Fisher matrix analysis for the prospects of differentiating among the different DE models in terms of the growth index, taken as a given function of redshift or with a principal component analysis, with a value for each redshift bin for a Euclid-like survey. We use as observables the complete and marginalized power spectrum of galaxies P(k) and the Weak Lensing (WL) power spectrum. We find that, using P(k), one can reach (2\%, 5\%) errors in (w(0); w(a)), and (4\%, 12\%) errors in (gamma(0); gamma(a)), while using WL we get errors at least twice as large. These estimates allow us to differentiate easily between DGP, f(R) models and Lambda CDM, while it would be more difficult to distinguish the latter from a variable equation of state parameter or LTB models using only the growth index.

Bouncing Galileon cosmologies	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/10/036	We present nonsingular, homogeneous and isotropic bouncing solutions of the conformal Galileon model. We show that such solutions necessarily begin with a radiation-dominated contracting phase. This is followed by a quintom scenario in which the background equation of state crosses the cosmological constant boundary allowing for a nonsingular bounce which in turn is followed by Galilean Genesis. We analyze the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in this background. Our results show that the fluctuations evolve smoothly and without any pathology, but the adiabatic modes form a blue tilted spectrum. In order to achieve a scale-invariant primordial power spectrum as required by current observations, we introduce a light scalar field coupling to the Galileon kinetically. We find two couplings which yield a scale-invariant spectrum, one of which requires a fine tuning of the initial conditions. This model also predicts a blue tilted spectrum of gravitational waves stemming from quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Noether symmetry for Gauss-Bonnet dilatonic gravity	10.1007/s10714-011-1207-5	Noether symmetry for Gauss-Bonnet Dilatonic interaction exists for a constant dilatonic scalar potential and a linear functional dependence of the coupling parameter on the scalar field. The symmetry with the same form of the potential and coupling parameter exists all in the vacuum, radiation and matter dominated era. The late time acceleration is driven by the effective cosmological constant rather than the Gauss-Bonnet term, while the later compensates for the large value of the effective cosmological constant giving a plausible answer to the well-known coincidence problem.

Non-vacuum conformally flat space-times: dark energy	10.1007/s10509-011-0767-x	In this paper we propose a class of exact solutions (stationary and non-stationary) of Einstein's field equations. We find that the space-time geometries of the solutions are non-vacuum and conformally flat, whose energy-momentum tensors possess dark energy with negative pressure and the energy equation of state parameter w=-1/2. We also find that the time-like vector fields of the matter distributions of the solutions are expanding, shearing with acceleration and zero-twist. It is also found that, due to the negative pressure, the energy-momentum tensors violate the strong energy conditions leading to the repulsive gravitational fields of the space-time geometries. Energy-momentum tensors for the solutions also obey the energy conservation equations. From these physical properties of the matter distribution we may refer the space-times to as examples of exact solutions of the Einstein's field equations admitting dark energy with negative pressure. It is to note that the approximate sizes of the masses of the (stationary and non-stationary) solutions are less than (1/2)x10(-60) in Bousso's length scale r > 10(60). We also find that the surface gravities on the horizons are directly proportional to their respective masses.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Mass varying neutrinos in supernovae	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.053010	We study the consequences on the neutrino oscillation parameter space, mixing angle (tan(2)theta) vacuum mass difference (Delta m(0)(2) when mass varying neutrino (MaVaN) models are assumed in a supernova environment. We consider electronic to sterile channels) nu(e) -> nu(s) and (nu) over bar (e) -> (nu) over bar (s) in two-flavor scenario. In a given model of MaVaN mechanism, we induce a position-dependent effective mass difference, Delta(m) over tilde (2)(r) where r is the distance from the supernova core, that changes the neutrino and antineutrino flavor conversion probabilities. We study the constraints on the mixing angle and vacuum mass difference coming from r-process and the SN1987A data. Our result is the appearance of a new exclusion region for very small mixing angles, tan(2)theta = 10(-6)-10(-2) and small vacuum mass difference, Delta m(0)(2) = 1-20 eV(2), due the MaVaN mechanism.

Birkhoff's theorem in f (T) gravity	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1755-6	Generalized from the so-called teleparallel gravity, which is exactly equivalent to general relativity, f (T) gravity has been proposed as an alternative gravity model to account for the dark energy phenomena. In this letter we prove that the external vacuum gravitational field for a spherically symmetric distribution of source matter in the f (T) gravity framework must be static. The conclusion is independent of the radial distribution and spherically symmetric motion of the source matter, that is, whether it is in motion or static. As a consequence, the Birkhoff's theorem is valid in the general nonsingular f (T) theory at the un-perturbative level. We also discuss its application in the de Sitter spacetime evolution phase as preferred by present dark energy observations.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C

The Einstein's field equations have been solved by applying a variation law for generalized Hubble's parameter (Berman in Il Nuovo Cimento B 74:182, 1983) which generates two types of solutions, one is of power-law type and other is of the exponential form. The existing range of the dark energy EoS parameter omega for derived model is found to be in good agreement with the three recent observations (i) SNe Ia data (Knop et al. in Astrophys. J. 598:102, 2003), (ii) SNe Ia data collaborated with CMBR anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics (Tegmark et al. in Astrophys. J. 606:702, 2004) and (iii) a combination of cosmological datasets coming from CMB anisotropies, luminosity distances of high redshift type Ia supernovae and galaxy clustering (Hinshaw et al. in Astrophys. J. Suppl. Ser. 180:225, 2009 and Komatsu et al. in Astrophys. J. Suppl. Ser. 180:330, 2009). The cosmological constant I > is found to be a decreasing function of time and it approaches a small positive value at the present epoch which is corroborated by results from recent supernovae Ia observations. It has also been suggested that the dark energy that explains the observed accelerating universe may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the EoS in a time dependent background. Geometric and kinematic properties of the model and the behaviour of the anisotropy of the dark energy have been carried out.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Effective inhomogeneous inflation: curvature inhomogeneities of the Einstein vacuum	10.1088/0264-9381/28/16/162002	We consider spatially averaged inhomogeneous universe models and argue that, already in the absence of sources, an effective scalar field arises through foliating and spatially averaging inhomogeneous geometrical curvature invariants of the Einstein vacuum. This scalar field (the `morphon') acts as an inflaton, if we prescribe a potential of some generic form. We show that, for any initially negative average spatial curvature, the morphon is driven through an inflationary phase and leads-on average-to a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe model, providing initial conditions for pre-heating and, by the same mechanism, a possibly natural self-exit.

D-foam-induced flavor condensates and breaking of supersymmetry in free Wess-Zumino fluids	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.044050	Recently [N. E. Mavromatos and S. Sarkar, New J. Phys. 10, 073009 (2008); N. E. Mavromatos, S. Sarkar, and W. Tarantino, Phys. Rev. D 80, 084046 (2009)], we argued that a particular model of string-inspired quantum space-time foam (D-foam) may induce oscillations and mixing among flavored particles. As a result, rather than the mass-eigenstate vacuum, the correct ground state to describe the underlying dynamics is the flavor vacuum, proposed some time ago by Blasone and Vitiello as a description of quantum field theories with mixing. At the microscopic level, the breaking of target-space supersymmetry is induced in our space-time foam model by the relative transverse motion of brane defects. Motivated by these results, we show that the flavor vacuum, introduced through an inequivalent representation of the canonical (anti-) commutation relations, provides a vehicle for the breaking of supersymmetry at a low-energy effective field-theory level; on considering the flavor-vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and comparing with the form of a perfect relativistic fluid, it is found that the bosonic sector contributes as dark energy while the fermion contribution is like dust. This indicates a strong and novel breaking of supersymmetry, of a nonperturbative nature, which may characterize the low-energy field theory of certain quantum-gravity models.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Constraints from the CMB temperature and other common observational data sets on variable dark energy density models	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.043517	The thermodynamic and dynamical properties of a variable dark energy model with density scaling as rho(x) proportional to(1 + z)(m), z being the redshift, are discussed following the outline of Jetzer et al. [P. Jetzer, D. Puy, M. Signore, and C. Tortora, Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 43, 1083 (2011).]. These kinds of models are proven to lead to the creation/disruption of matter and radiation, which affect the cosmic evolution of both matter and radiation components in the Universe. In particular, we have concentrated on the temperature-redshift relation of radiation, which has been constrained using a very recent collection of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature measurements up to z similar to 3. For the first time, we have combined this observational probe with a set of independent measurements (Supernovae Ia distance moduli, CMB anisotropy, large-scale structure and observational data for the Hubble parameter), which are commonly adopted to constrain dark energy models. We find that, within the uncertainties, the model is indistinguishable from a cosmological constant which does not exchange any particles with other components. Anyway, while temperature measurements and Supernovae Ia tend to predict slightly decaying models, the contrary happens if CMB data are included. Future observations, in particular, measurements of CMB temperature at large redshift, will allow to give firmer bounds on the effective equation of state parameter w(eff) of this kind of dark energy model.

Observational tests for Lambda(t)CDM cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/08/022	We investigate the observational viability of a class of cosmological models in which the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, resulting in a production of cold dark matter particles at late times. Similarly to the flat Lambda CDM case, there is only one free parameter to be adjusted by the data in this class of Lambda(t)CDM scenarios, namely, the matter density parameter. To perform our analysis we use three of the most recent SNe Ia compilation sets (Union2, SDSS and Constitution) along with the current measurements of distance to the BAO peaks at z = 0.2 and z = 0.35 and the position of the first acoustic peak of the CMB power spectrum. We show that in terms of chi(2) statistics both models provide good fits to the data and similar results. A quantitative analysis discussing the differences in parameter estimation due to SNe light-curve fitting methods (SALT2 and MLCS2k2) is studied using the current SDSS and Constitution SNe Ia compilations. A matter power spectrum analysis using the 2dFGRS is also performed, providing a very good concordance with the constraints from the SDSS and Constitution MLCS2k2 data.

Gravitational waves in viable f(R) models	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/08/029	We study gravitational waves in viable f(R) theories under a non-zero background curvature. In general, an f(R) theory contains an extra scalar degree of freedom corresponding to a massive scalar mode of gravitational wave. For viable f(R) models, since there always exits a de-Sitter point where the background curvature in vacuum is non-zero, the mass squared of the scalar mode of gravitational wave is about the de-Sitter point curvature R-d similar to 10(-66) eV(2). We illustrate our results in two types of viable f(R) models: the exponential gravity and Starobinsky models. In both cases, the mass will be in the order of 10(-33) eV when it propagates in vacuum. However, in the presence of matter density in galaxy, the scalar mode can be heavy. Explicitly, in the exponential gravity model, the mass becomes almost infinity, implying the disappearance of the scalar mode of gravitational wave, while the Starobinsky model gives the lowest mass around 10(-24)eV, corresponding to the lowest frequency of 10(-9) Hz, which may be detected by the current and future gravitational wave probes, such as LISA and ASTROD-GW.

Quintessential holography	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.044004	By using the Bousso geometrical covariant procedure we consider in this paper the holographic principle as applied to asymptotic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-times whose vacuum dark energy is due to the presence of a quintessential dark and phantom-energy scalar field with constant equation of state p = omega rho, both for w > -1 and w < -1. We have obtained the positions of the optimal screen for each case, deriving for them moreover expressions for the future event horizon and hence holographic dark-energy models of the Li and Huang and Li types, which are compared with the most consistent results derived from the covariant Bousso procedure. It is also seen that one of the two obtained holographic screens is placed on the big rip hypersurface in the phantom-energy case, both for the covariant holographic formalism and holographic phantom models. Consistency of fundamental theories is analyzed in the light of the largest physical regions allowed by the existence of a holographic screen in the future.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Quintessence ghost dark energy model	10.1209/0295-5075/95/39001	A so-called ``ghost dark energy{''} was recently proposed to explain the present acceleration of the universe expansion. The energy density of ghost dark energy, which originates from the Veneziano ghost of QCD, is proportional to the Hubble parameter, rho(D) = alpha H, where alpha is a constant which is related to the QCD mass scale. In this paper, we establish the correspondence between ghost dark energy and quintessence scalar-field energy density. This connection allows us to reconstruct the potential and the dynamics of the quintessence scalar-field according to the evolution of ghost energy density. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2011	EPL
Magnetized Bianchi Type III String Universe with Time Decaying Vacuum Energy Density Lambda	10.1007/s10773-011-0744-8	Exact solution of Einstein's field equations is obtained for massive string cosmological model of Bianchi III space-time using the technique given by Letelier (Phys. Rev. D 28:2414, 1983) in presence of perfect fluid and decaying vacuum energy density I >. To get the deterministic solution of the field equations the expansion theta in the model is considered as proportional to the eigen value sigma(2)(2) of the shear tensor sigma(j)(i) and also the fluid obeys the barotropic equation of state. It is observed that the particle density and the tension density of the string are comparable at the two ends and they fall off asymptotically at similar rate. But in early stage as well as at the late time of the evolution of the universe we have two types of scenario (i) universe is dominated by massive strings and (ii) universe is dominated by strings depending on the nature of the two constants L and a{''}{''}. The value of cosmological constant I > for the model is found to be small and positive which is supported by the results from recent supernovae Ia observations. Some physical and geometric properties of the model are also discussed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Cosmological dark fluid from five-dimensional vacuum	10.1103/PhysRevD.84.027503	In the framework of the induced matter theory of gravity, we derive a five-dimensional solution of the field equations that can describe a four-dimensional cosmological scenario where the dark fluid (dark matter plus dark energy) equation of state has a geometrical origin. There is not a natural separation of the dark sector into different components, and so the model may provide a geometrical explanation for the existence of a dark degeneracy in cosmological scenarios.

Charged gravastars admitting conformal motion	10.1016/j.physletb.2011.06.001	We propose a new model of a gravastar admitting conformal motion. While retaining the framework of the Mazur-Mottola model, the gravastar is assumed to be internally charged, with an exterior defined by a Reissner-Nordstrom instead of a Schwarzschild line element. The solutions, obtained by exploiting an assumed conformal Killing vector, involve (i) the interior region, (ii) the shell, and (iii) the exterior region of the sphere. Of these three cases the first one is of primary interest since the total gravitational mass here turns out to be an electromagnetic mass under some specific conditions. This suggests that the interior de Sitter vacuum of a charged gravastar is essentially an electromagnetic mass model that must generate gravitational mass which provides a stable configuration by balancing the repulsive pressure arising from charge with its attractive gravity to avert a singularity. Therefore the present model, like the Mazur-Mottola model, results in the construction of a compact astrophysical object, as an alternative to a black hole. We have also analyzed various other aspects such as the stress energy tensor in the thin shell and the entropy of the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Tomography from the next generation of cosmic shear experiments for viable f(R) models	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/07/016	We present the cosmic shear signal predicted by two viable cosmological models in the framework of modified-action f(R) theories. We use f (R) models where the current accelerated expansion of the Universe is a direct consequence of the modified gravitational Lagrangian rather than Dark Energy (DE), either in the form of vacuum energy/cosmological constant or of a dynamical scalar field (e.g. quintessence). We choose Starobinsky's (St) and Hu & Sawicki's (HS) f(R) models, which are carefully designed to pass the Solar System gravity tests. In order to further support - or rule out - f(R) theories as alternative candidates to the DE hypothesis, we exploit the power of weak gravitational lensing, specifically of cosmic shear. We calculate the tomographic shear matrix as it would be measured by the upcoming ESA Cosmic Vision Euclid satellite. We find that in the St model the cosmic shear signal is almost completely degenerate with Lambda CDM but it is easily distinguishable in the HS model. Moreover, we compute the corresponding Fisher matrix for both the St and LIS models, thus obtaining forecasts for their cosmological parameters. Finally, we show that the Bayes factor for cosmic shear will definitely favour the HS model over Lambda CDM if Euclid measures a value larger than similar to 0.02 for the extra HS parameter n(HS).

Effects of f(R) model on the dynamical instability of expansionfree gravitational collapse	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/07/022	Dark energy models based on f(R) theory have been extensively studied in literature to realize the late time acceleration. In this paper, we have chosen a viable f (R) model and discussed its effects on the dynamical instability of expansionfree fluid evolution generating a central vacuum cavity. For this purpose, contracted Bianchi identities are obtained for both the usual matter as well as dark source. The term dark source is named to the higher order curvature corrections arising from f(R) gravity. The perturbation scheme is applied and different terms belonging to Newtonian and post Newtonian regimes are identified. It is found that instability range of expansionfree fluid on external boundary as well as on internal vacuum cavity is independent of adiabatic index I but depends upon the density profile, pressure anisotropy and f(R) model.

Running coupling: does the coupling between dark energy and dark matter change sign during the cosmological evolution?	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1700-8	In this paper we put forward a running coupling scenario for describing the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. The dark sector interaction in our scenario is free of the assumption that the interaction term Q is proportional to the Hubble expansion rate and the energy densities of dark sectors. We only use a time-variable coupling b(a) (with a the scale factor of the universe) to characterize the interaction Q. We propose a parametrization form for the running coupling b(a) = b(0)a + b(e)(1 - a) in which the early-time coupling is given by a constant b(e), while to-day the coupling is given by another constant, b(0). For investigating the feature of the running coupling, we employ three dark energy models, namely, the cosmological constant model (w = -1), the constant w model (w = w(0)), and the time-dependent w model (w(a) = w(0) + w(1)(1 - a)). We constrain the models with the current observational data, including the type Ia supernova, the baryon acoustic oscillation, the cosmic microwave background, the Hubble expansion rate, and the X-ray gas mass fraction data. The fitting results indicate that a time-varying vacuum scenario is favored, in which the coupling b(z) crosses the noninteracting line (b = 0) during the cosmological evolution and the sign changes from negative to positive. The crossing of the noninteracting line happens at around z = 0.2-0.3, and the crossing behavior is favored at about 1 sigma confidence level. Our work implies that we should pay more attention to the time-varying vacuum model and seriously consider the phenomenological construction of a sign-changeable or oscillatory interaction between dark sectors.

Kaluza-Klein cosmology with varying G and Lambda	10.1007/s10509-011-0711-0	In this paper we investigate non-compact FRW type Kaluza-Klein cosmology coupled with 5D energy-momentum tensor. The field equations are solved by taking gravitational and cosmological constants as a function of time t. We use I >(t)=epsilon H (2) to explore cosmological parameters including statefinder and discuss them for dust, radiation and stiff matter dominated eras. Also, we evaluate lookback time, proper distance, luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. We obtain a universe which is not compatible with current cosmological observations at epsilon=6. However, for epsilon > 6, the results are compatible with observational cosmology.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Space-Time Curvature Induced by Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations as an Alternative to Dark Energy	10.1007/s10773-010-0633-6	It is shown that quantum vacuum fluctuations give rise to a curvature of space-time of the order appropriate to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The fact that the fluctuations produce curvature, even if the expectation of the vacuum energy vanishes, is a consequence of the non-linear character of the Einstein equation. A calculation is made, involving plausible hypotheses within quantized gravity, which establishes a relation between the two-point correlation of the vacuum fluctuations and the space-time curvature.

Axiverse extended: Vacuum destabilization, early dark energy, and cosmological collapse	10.1103/PhysRevD.83.123526	A model is presented in the philosophy of the ``String Axiverse'' of [A. Arvanitaki, S. Dimopoulos, S. Dubovsky, N. Kaloper, and J. March-Russell, Phys. Rev. D 81, 123530 (2010).] that incorporates a coupling of ultralight axions to their corresponding moduli through the mass term. The light fields roll in their potentials at late times and contribute to the dark sector energy densities in the cosmological expansion. The addition of a coupling and extra field greatly enrich the possible phenomenology of the axiverse. There are a number of interesting phases where the axion and modulus components behave as dark matter or dark energy and can have considerable and distinct effects on the expansion history of the universe by modifying the equation of state in the past or causing possible future collapse of the universe. In future such a coupling may help to alleviate fine tuning problems for cosmological axions. We motivate and present the model, and briefly explore its cosmological consequences numerically.

Cosmological constant from decoherence	10.1088/0264-9381/28/12/125022	We address the issue why a cosmological constant (dark energy) possesses a small positive value instead of being zero. Motivated by the cosmic landscape picture, we mimic the dark energy by a scalar field with potential wells and show that other degrees of freedom interacting with it can localize this field by decoherence in one of the wells. Dark energy can then acquire a small positive value. We also show that the additional degrees of freedom enhance the tunneling rate between the wells. The consideration is performed in detail for the case of two wells and then extended to a large number of wells.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Early and late-time cosmic acceleration in non-minimal Yang-Mills-f(G) gravity	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1684-4	In this paper we show that power-law inflation can be realized in non-minimal gravitational coupling of Yang-Mills field with a general function of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant in the framework of Einstein gravity. Such a non-minimal coupling may appear due to quantum corrections. We also discuss the non-minimal Yang-Mills-f(G) gravity in the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet action which is widely studied recently. It is shown that both inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration are possible in such a theory.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C

Filtering out the cosmological constant in the Palatini formalism of modified gravity	10.1007/s10714-011-1153-2	According to theoretical physics the cosmological constant (CC) is expected to be much larger in magnitude than other energy densities in the universe, which is in stark contrast to the observed Big Bang evolution. We address this old CC problem not by introducing an extremely fine-tuned counterterm, but in the context of modified gravity in the Palatini formalism. In our model the large CC term is filtered out, and it does not prevent a standard cosmological evolution. We discuss the filter effect in the epochs of radiation and matter domination as well as in the asymptotic de Sitter future. The final expansion rate can be much lower than inferred from the large CC without using a fine-tuned counterterm. Finally, we show that the CC filter works also in the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) metric describing a black hole environment with a CC compatible to the future de Sitter cosmos.

Dark ingredients in one drop	10.2478/s11534-010-0071-3	A unified description of dark ingredients is realized by a vacuum dark fluid defined by symmetry of its stress-energy tensor and allowed by General Relativity. The symmetry is reduced compared with the maximally symmetric de Sitter vacuum, which makes vacuum dark fluid essentially anisotropic and allows its density and pressure to evolve. It represents distributed vacuum dark energy by a time-evolving and spatially inhomogeneous cosmological term, and vacuum dark matter by gravitational vacuum solitons which are regular gravitationally bound structures without horizons (dark particles or dark stars), with the de Sitter centre (I > I ` (k) (i) ) in de Sitter space (lambda I ` (k) (i) ).

D-FOAM PHENOMENOLOGY: DARK ENERGY, THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT AND A POSSIBLE D-VOID	10.1142/S0217751X11053353	In a D-brane model of cosmology and space-time foam, theta are contributions to the dark energy that depend on the D-brane 10-velocities and on the density of D-particle defects in the ten-dimensional bulk. The latter may also reduce the speeds of energetic photons, establishing a phenomenological connection with astrophysical probes of the universality of the velocity of light. Specifically, the cosmological dark energy density measured at the present epoch may be linked to the apparent retardation of energetic photons propagating from nearby AGN's. However, this nascent field of ``D-foam phenomenology{''} may be complicated by variations in the D-particle density encountered at different cosmological epochs. A reduced density of D-particles encountered at redshifts z similar to 1 - a ``D-void{''} - would increase the dark energy while suppressing the vacuum refractive index, and thereby might reconcile the AGN measurements with the relatively small retardation seen for the energetic photons propagating from GRB 090510, as measured by the Fermi satellite.

Vacuum fluctuations in a supersymmetric model in FRW spacetime	10.1103/PhysRevD.83.105003	We study a noninteracting supersymmetric model in an expanding FRW spacetime. A soft supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy density. A short distance cutoff of the order of Planck length provides a scale for the vacuum energy density comparable with the observed cosmological constant. Assuming the presence of a dark energy substance in addition to the vacuum fluctuations of the field, an effective equation of state is derived in a self-consistent approach. The effective equation of state is sensitive to the choice of the cutoff but no fine-tuning is needed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
The Hubble parameter in the early universe with viscous QCD matter and finite cosmological constant	10.1002/andp.201100038	The evolution of a flat, isotropic and homogeneous universe is studied. The background geometry in the early phases of the universe is conjectured to be filled with causal bulk viscous fluid and dark energy. The energy density relations obtained from the assumption of covariant conservation of energy-momentum tensor of the background matter in the early universe are used to derive the basic equation for the Hubble parameter H. The viscous properties described by ultra-relativistic equations of state and bulk viscosity taken from recent heavy-ion collisions and lattice QCD calculations have been utilized to give an approximate solution of the field equations. The cosmological constant is conjectured to be related to the energy density of the vacuum. In this treatment, there is a clear evidence for singularity at vanishing cosmic time t indicating the dominant contribution from the dark energy. The time evolution of H seems to last for much longer time than the ideal case, where both cosmological constant and viscosity coefficient are entirely vanishing. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Transition between phantom and non-phantom phases with time-dependent cosmological constant and Cardy-Verlinde formula	10.1209/0295-5075/94/49001	We investigate the transition phenomenon of the universe between a phantom and a non-phantom phase. Particular attention is devoted to the case in which the cosmological constant depends on time and is proportional to the square of the Hubble parameter. Inhomogeneous equations of state are used and the equation of motion is solved. We find that, depending on the choice of the input parameters, the universe can transit from the non-phantom to the phantom phase leading to the appearance of singularities. In particular, we find that the phantom universe ends in a singularity of type III, unlike the case without variable cosmological constant in which the phantom phase ends exclusively in the big rip (singularity of type I). The Cardy-Verlinde formula is also introduced for the inhomogeneous equation of state and we find that its equivalence with the total entropy of the universe, coming from the Friedmann equations, occurs only for a special choice of the input parameter m at the present time.

Lorentz-covariant quantum transport and the origin of dark energy	10.1088/0031-8949/83/05/055901	A possible explanation for the enigma of dark energy, responsible for about 76\% of the mass-energy of the universe, is obtained by requiring only that the rigorous continuity equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) for quanta propagating through space should have the form of a Lorentz-covariant and dispersion-free wave equation. This requirement implies (i) properties of space-time that an observer would describe as uniform expansion in agreement with Hubble's law and (ii) that the quantum transport behaves like in a multiplicative medium with multiplication factor nu = 2. This inherent, essentially explosive multiplicity of vacuum, caused by the requirement of Lorentz covariance, is suggested as a potential origin of dark energy. In addition, it is shown (iii) that this requirement of Lorentz-covariant quantum transport leads to an apparent accelerated expansion of the universe.	PHYSICA SCRIPTA
Nonminimal curvature-matter coupled wormholes with matter satisfying the null energy condition	10.1088/0264-9381/28/8/085018	Recently, the exact solutions of wormhole geometries supported by a nonminimal curvature-matter coupling were found, where the nonminimal coupling minimizes the violation of the null energy condition of normal matter at the throat. In this brief report, we present a solution where normal matter satisfies the energy conditions at the throat and it is the higher order curvature derivatives of the nonminimal coupling that are responsible for the null energy condition violation, and consequently for supporting the respective wormhole geometries. For simplicity, we consider a linear R nonmiminal curvature-matter coupling and an explicit monotonically increasing function for the energy density. Thus, the solution found is not asymptotically flat, but may in principle be matched to an exterior vacuum solution.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Gauss-Bonnet Lagrangian G lnG and cosmological exact solutions	10.1103/PhysRevD.83.083513	For the Lagrangian L = G lnG where G is the Gauss-Bonnet curvature scalar we deduce the field equation and solve it in closed form for 3-flat Friedmann models using a state-finder parametrization. Further we show that among all Lagrangians F(G) this L is the only one not having the form G(r) with a real constant r but possessing a scale-invariant field equation. This turns out to be one of its analogies to f(R) theories in two-dimensional space-time. In the appendix, we systematically list several formulas for the decomposition of the Riemann tensor in arbitrary dimensions n, which are applied in the main deduction for n = 4.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Possibilities and surprises of vacuum dark fluid	10.1134/S0202289311020113	We address the question of a unified description of dark energy and dark matter based on the spacetime symmetry which makes it possible to approach these two problems on a common ground. In this approach, a cosmological vacuum is described by a variable cosmological term whose symmetry is reduced as compared with the Einstein cosmological term, which allows the vacuum energy to be evolving and clustering. The relevant class of solutions to the Einstein equations implies the existence of compact vacuum objects generically related to dark energy: regular black holes, their remnants and self-gravitating vacuum solitons with de Sitter vacuum interior-which can be responsible for the observational effects typically related to dark matter. The mass of an objects with de Sitter interior is generically related to the vacuum dark energy and to spacetime symmetry breaking.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Cosmology with hypervelocity stars	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/04/023	In the standard cosmological model, the merger remnant of the Milky Way and Andromeda (Milkomeda) will be the only galaxy remaining within our event horizon once the Universe has aged by another factor of ten, similar to 10(11) years after the Big Bang. After that time, the only extragalactic sources of light in the observable cosmic volume will be hypervelocity stars being ejected continuously from Milkomeda. Spectroscopic detection of the velocity-distance relation or the evolution in the Doppler shifts of these stars will allow a precise measurement of the vacuum mass density as well as the local matter distribution. Already in the near future, the next generation of large telescopes will allow photometric detection of individual stars out to the edge of the Local Group, and may target the similar to 10(5+/-1) hypervelocity stars that originated in it as cosmological tracers.

Non-adiabatic perturbations in decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/04/028	We investigate a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology in which a decaying vacuum term causes matter production at late times. Assuming a decay proportional to the Hubble rate, the ratio of the background energy densities of dark matter and dark energy changes with the cosmic scale factor as a(-3/2). The intrinsically non-adiabatic two-component perturbation dynamics of this model is reduced to a single second-order equation. Perturbations of the vacuum term are shown to be negligible on scales that are relevant for structure formation. On larger scales, dark-energy perturbations give a somewhat higher contribution but remain always smaller than the dark-matter perturbations.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Limits on decaying dark energy density models from the CMB temperature-redshift relation	10.1007/s10714-010-1091-4	The nature of the dark energy is still a mystery and several models have been proposed to explain it. Here we consider a phenomenological model for dark energy decay into photons and particles as proposed by Lima (Phys Rev D 54:2571, 1996). He studied the thermodynamic aspects of decaying dark energy models in particular in the case of a continuous photon creation and/or disruption. Following his approach, we derive a temperature redshift relation for the cosmic microwave background (CMB) which depends on the effective equation of state w (eff) and on the ``adiabatic index{''} gamma. Comparing our relation with the data on the CMB temperature as a function of the redshift obtained from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations and at higher redshift from quasar absorption line spectra, we find w (eff) = -0.97 +/- 0.03, adopting for the adiabatic index gamma = 4/3, in good agreement with current estimates and still compatible with w (eff) = -1, implying that the dark energy content being constant in time.

Dark energy model in anisotropic Bianchi type-III space-time with variable EoS parameter	10.1007/s10509-010-0539-z	A new dark energy model in anisotropic Bianchi type-III space-time with variable equation of state (EoS) parameter has been investigated in the present paper. To get the deterministic model, we consider that the expansion theta in the model is proportional to the eigen value of the shear tensor. The EoS parameter omega is found to be time dependent and its existing range for this model is in good agreement with the recent observations of SNe Ia data (Knop et al. in Astrophys. J. 598:102, 2003) and SNe Ia data with CMBR anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics (Tegmark et al. in Astrophys. J. 606:702, 2004). It has been suggested that the dark energy that explains the observed accelerating expansion of the universe may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the EoS in a time dependent background. Some physical aspects of dark energy model are also discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Non-vacuum solutions of Bianchi type VI (0) universe in f(R) gravity	10.1007/s10509-010-0511-y	In this paper, we solve the field equations in metric f(R) gravity for Bianchi type VI (0) spacetime and discuss evolution of the expanding universe. We find two types of non-vacuum solutions by taking isotropic and anisotropic fluids as the source of matter and dark energy. The physical behavior of these solutions is analyzed and compared in the future evolution with the help of some physical and geometrical parameters. It is concluded that in the presence of isotropic fluid, the model has singularity at and represents continuously expanding shearing universe currently entering into phantom phase. In anisotropic fluid, the model has no initial singularity and exhibits the uniform accelerating expansion. However, the spacetime does not achieve isotropy as t -> a in both of these solutions.

Dark energy as space-time curvature induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations	10.1007/s10509-010-0557-x	It is shown that quantum vacuum fluctuations give rise to a curvature of space-time equivalent to a cosmological constant, that is a homogeneous energy density rho and pressure p fulfilling -p=rho > 0. The fact that the fluctuations produce curvature, even if the vacuum expectation of the energy vanishes, is a consequence of the non-linear character of the Einstein equation. A calculation is made, involving plausible hypotheses within quantized gravity, which establishes a relation between the two-point correlation of the vacuum fluctuations and the space-time curvature. Arguments are given which suggest that the density rho might be of order the ``dark energy{''} density currently assumed to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.

Cosmological constant from quarks and torsion	10.1002/andp.201000162	We present a simple and natural way to derive the observed small, positive cosmological constant from the gravitational interaction of condensing fermions. In the Riemann-Cartan spacetime, torsion gives rise to the axial-axial vector four-fermion interaction term in the Dirac Lagrangian for spinor fields. We show that this nonlinear term acts like a cosmological constant if these fields have a nonzero vacuum expectation value. For quark fields in QCD, such a torsion-induced cosmological constant is positive and its energy scale is only about 8 times larger than the observed value. Adding leptons to this picture could lower this scale to the observed value. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
The cosmological constant puzzle	10.1088/0954-3899/38/4/043201	The accelerating expansion of the Universe points to a small positive vacuum energy density and negative vacuum pressure. A strong candidate is the cosmological constant in Einstein's equations of general relativity. Possible contributions are zero-point energies and the condensates associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The vacuum energy density extracted from astrophysics is 10(56) times smaller than the value expected from quantum fields and standard model particle physics. Is the vacuum energy density time dependent? We give an introduction to the cosmological constant puzzle and ideas how to solve it.	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS G-NUCLEAR AND PARTICLE PHYSICS
LRS Bianchi type II stiff fluid cosmological model with decaying vacuum energy density Lambda in general relativity	10.1016/j.physletb.2011.02.046	Locally rotationally symmetric (L.R.S.) Bianchi type II stiff fluid cosmological model is investigated. To get the deterministic model of the universe, we have assumed a supplementary condition A = B(m) between metric potentials A and B, where m is a constant. It is shown that the vacuum energy density A is positive and proportional to t(1/2). The values of deceleration parameter q, matter-energy density Omega(m) and dark-energy density Omega(Lambda) are found to be in good agreement with the values obtain from 5-years WMAP observations. The predicted value of the jerk parameter is in agreement with the SNLS SNIa and X-ray galaxy cluster distance data but it is not match with the SNIa gold sample data. In general, the model represent accelerating, shearing and non-rotating universe. The physical and geometrical behavior of this model is also discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From confinement to dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2011.02.024	The infrared divergence of the self-energy of a color charge is due to an enhancement of the long wavelength modes of the color Coulomb potential field. There are also long wavelength contributions to the QCD vacuum energy that are similarly enhanced. Vacuum modes of Hubble scale wavelengths may be affected in a cosmological setting and this can lead to a residual positive energy density of the form H-d Lambda(4-d)(QCD) Lattice studies constrain d. If the dark energy takes this form then the universe is driven towards de Sitter expansion, and we briefly study this cosmology when d is just slightly above unity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Zero-point quantum fluctuations and dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.83.063514	In the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the energy associated to an asymptotically flat space-time with metric g(mu nu) is related to the Hamiltonian H(GR) by E = H(GR)[g(mu nu)] - H(GR)[eta(mu nu)], where the subtraction of the flat-space contribution is necessary to get rid of an otherwise divergent boundary term. This classic result indicates that the energy associated to flat space does not gravitate. We apply the same principle to study the effect of the zero-point fluctuations of quantum fields in cosmology, proposing that their contribution to cosmic expansion is obtained computing the vacuum energy of quantum fields in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time with Hubble parameter H(t) and subtracting from it the flat-space contribution. Then the term proportional to Lambda(4)(c) (where Lambda(c) is the UV cutoff) cancels, and the remaining (bare) value of the vacuum energy density is proportional to Lambda(2)(c)H(2)(t). After renormalization, this produces a renormalized vacuum energy density similar to M(2)H(2)(t), where M is the scale where quantum gravity sets is, so for M of the order of the Planck mass a vacuum energy density of the order of the critical density can be obtained without any fine-tuning. The counterterms can be chosen so that the renormalized energy density and pressure satisfy p = w rho, with w a parameter that can be fixed by comparison to the observed value, so, in particular, one can choose w = -1. An energy density evolving in time as H(2)(t) is however observationally excluded as an explanation for the dominant dark energy component that is responsible for the observed acceleration of the Universe. We rather propose that zero-point vacuum fluctuations provide a new subdominant ``dark{''} contribution to the cosmic expansion that, for a UV scale M slightly smaller than the Planck mass, is consistent with existing limits and potentially detectable.

A class of new LRS Bianchi type-I perfect fluid universes with decaying vacuum energy density Lambda		A class of new LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological models with a variable cosmological term is investigated in presence of perfect fluid. A procedure to generate new exact solutions to Einstein's field equations is applied to LRS Bianchi type-I space-time. Starting from some known solutions a class of new perfect fluid solutions of LRS Bianchi type-I are obtained. The cosmological constant Lambda is found to be positive and a decreasing function of time which is supported by results from recent supernovae la observations. The physical and geometric properties of spatially homogeneous and anisotropic cosmological models are discussed.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
An approach to dark energy problem through linear invariants	10.1088/1674-1137/35/3/005	The time evolution of vacuum energy density is investigated in the coherent states of inflationary universe using a linear invariant approach. The linear invariants we derived are represented in terms of annihilation operators. On account of the fact that the coherent state is an eigenstate of an annihilation operator, the wave function in the coherent state is easily evaluated by solving the eigenvalue equation of the linear invariants. The expectation value of the vacuum energy density is derived using this wave function. Fluctuations of the scalar field and its conjugate momentum are also investigated. Our theory based on the linear invariant shows that the vacuum energy density of the universe in a coherent state is decreased continuously with time due to nonconservative force acting on the coherent oscillations of the scalar field, which is provided by the expansion of the universe. In effect, our analysis reveals that the vacuum energy density decreases in proportion to t(-beta) where beta is 3/2 for radiation-dominated era and 2 for matter-dominated era. In the case where the duration term of radiation-dominated era is short enough to be negligible, the estimation of the relic vacuum energy density agrees well with the current observational data.

Observational constraints on decaying vacuum dark energy model	10.1140/epjc/s10052-011-1586-5	The decaying vacuum model (DV), treating dark energy as a varying vacuum, has been studied well recently. The vacuum energy decays linearly with the Hubble parameter in the late-times, rho(Lambda)(t) alpha H(t), and produces the additional matter component. We constrain the parameters of the DV model using the recent data-sets from supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, CMB, the Hubble rate and X-rays in galaxy clusters. It is found that the best fit of the matter density contrast Omega(m) in the DV model is much lager than that in Lambda CDM model. We give the confidence contours in the Omega(m)-h plane up to 3 sigma confidence level. Besides, the normalized likelihoods of Omega(m) and h are presented, respectively.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Reconstructing f(R) modified gravity from ordinary and entropy-corrected versions of the holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models	10.1007/JHEP03(2011)086	Here, we peruse cosmological usage of the most promising candidates of dark energy in the framework of f(R) theory. We reconstruct the different f(R) modified gravity models in the spatially flat FRW universe according to the ordinary and entropy-corrected versions of the holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe. We also obtain the equation of state parameter of the corresponding f(R)-gravity models. We conclude that the holographic and new agegraphic f(R)-gravity models can behave like phantom or quintessence models. Whereas the equation of state parameter of the entropy-corrected models can transit from quintessence state to phantom regime as indicated by recent observations.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Mass varying neutrinos, quintessence, and the accelerating expansion of the Universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.83.045033	We analyze the mass varying neutrino scenario. We consider a minimal model of massless Dirac fermions coupled to a scalar field, mainly in the framework of finite-temperature quantum field theory. We demonstrate that the mass equation we find has nontrivial solutions only for special classes of potentials, and only within certain temperature intervals. We give most of our results for the Ratra-Peebles dark energy (DE) potential. The thermal (temporal) evolution of the model is analyzed. Following the time arrow, the stable, metastable, and unstable phases are predicted. The model predicts that the present Universe is below its critical temperature and accelerates. At the critical point, the Universe undergoes a first-order phase transition from the (meta) stable oscillatory regime to the unstable rolling regime of the DE field. This conclusion agrees with the original idea of quintessence as a force making the Universe roll towards its true vacuum with a zero Lambda term. The present mass varying neutrino scenario is free from the coincidence problem, since both the DE density and the neutrino mass are determined by the scale M of the potential. Choosing M similar to 10(-3) eV to match the present DE density, we can obtain the present neutrino mass in the range m similar to 10(-2)-1 eV and consistent estimates for other parameters of the Universe.

The dynamical equivalence of modified gravity revisited	10.1088/0264-9381/28/3/035002	We revisit the dynamical equivalence between different representations of vacuum modified gravity models in view of Legendre transformations. The equivalence is discussed for both bulk and boundary space, by including in our analysis the relevant Gibbons-Hawking terms. In the f(R) case, the Legendre transformed action coincides with the usual Einstein frame one. We then re-express the R + f(G) action, where G is the Gauss-Bonnet term, as a second-order theory with a new set of field variables, four tensor fields and one scalar and study its dynamics. For completeness, we also calculate the conformal transformation of the full Jordan frame R + f(G) action. All the appropriate Gibbons-Hawking terms are calculated explicitly.

Role of deceleration parameter and interacting dark energy in singularity avoidance	10.1007/s10509-010-0461-4	A class of non-singular bouncing FRW models are obtained by constraining the deceleration parameter in the presence of an interacting dark energy represented by a time-varying cosmological constant. The models being geometrically closed, initially accelerate for a certain period of time and decelerate thereafter and are also free from the entropy and cosmological constant problems. Taking a constant of integration equal to zero one particular model is discussed in some detail and the variation of different cosmological parameters are shown graphically for specific values of the parameters of the model. For some specific choice of the parameters of the model the ever expanding models of Ozer & Taha and Abdel-Rahman and the decelerating models of Berman and also the Einstein de-Sitter model may be obtained as special cases of this particular model.

Exact solution of perfect fluid massive string cosmology in Bianchi type III space-time with decaying vacuum energy density Lambda	10.1007/s10509-010-0469-9	Exact solution of Einstein's field equations is obtained for massive string cosmological model of Bianchi III space-time using the technique given by Letelier (Phys. Rev. D 20:2414, 1983) in presence of perfect fluid and decaying vacuum energy density Lambda. To get the deterministic solution of the field equations the expansion theta in the model is considered as proportional to the eigen value sigma(2)(2) of the shear tensor sigma(i)(i) and also the fluid obeys the barotropic equation of state. The vacuum energy density Lambda is found to be positive and a decreasing function of time which is supported by the results from recent supernovae Ia observations. It is also observed that in early stage of the evolution of the universe string dominates over the particle whereas the universe is dominated by massive string at the late time. Some physical and geometric properties of the model are also discussed.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
On the cosmological constant problem and brane-world geometry	10.2478/s11534-010-0046-4	The cosmological constant problem is examined within the context of the covariant brane-world gravity, based on Nash's embedding theorem for Riemannian geometries. We show that the vacuum structure of the brane-world is more complex than General Relativity's because it involves extrinsic elements, in specific, the extrinsic curvature. In other words, the shape (or local curvature) of an object becomes a relative concept, instead of the ``absolute shape{''} of General Relativity. We point out that the immediate consequence is that the cosmological constant and the energy density of the vacuum quantum fluctuations have different physical meanings: while the vacuum energy density remains confined to the four-dimensional brane-world, the cosmological constant is a property of the bulk's gravitational field that leads to the conclusion that these quantities cannot be compared, as it is usually done in General Relativity. Instead, the vacuum energy density contributes to the extrinsic curvature, which in turn generates Nash's perturbation of the gravitational field. On the other hand, the cosmological constant problem ceases to be in the brane-world geometry, reappearing only in the limit where the extrinsic curvature vanishes.

Bianchi Type-III Magnetized Wet Dark Fluid Cosmological Model in General Relativity	10.1007/s10773-010-0530-z	Bianchi type-III cosmological model of universe filled with dark energy from a wet dark fluid (WDF) in presence and absence of magnetic field is investigated in general theory of relativity. We assume that F (12) is the only non-vanishing component of F (ij) . We obtain exact solutions to the field equations using the condition that expansion is proportional to the shear scalar i.e. (B=C (n) ). The physical behavior of the model is discussed with and without magnetic field. We conclude that universe model do not approach isotropy through the evolution of the universe.

Screening of cosmological constant in non-local gravity	10.1016/j.physletb.2010.12.035	We discuss a possible mechanism to screen a cosmological constant in non-local gravity. We find that in a simple model of non-local gravity with the Lagrangian of the form, R + f (rectangle(-1) R) - 2 Lambda where f (X) is a quadratic function of X, there is a flat spacetime solution despite the presence of the cosmological constant Lambda. Unfortunately, however, we also find that this solution contains a ghost in general. Then we discuss the condition to avoid a ghost and find that one can avoid it only for a finite range of `time'. Nevertheless our result suggests the possibility of solving the cosmological constant problem in the context of non-local gravity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Dark energy and QCD ghost	10.1016/j.physletb.2010.11.044	It has been suggested that the dark energy that explains the observed accelerating expansion of the universe may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the QCD ghost in a time-dependent background. The argument uses a four-dimensional simplified model. In this Letter, we put the discussion in more realistic model keeping all components of the QCD vector ghost and show that indeed QCD ghost produces dark energy proportional to the Hubble parameter H Lambda(3)(QCD) (Lambda(QCD) is the QCD mass scale) which has the right magnitude similar to(3 x 10(-3) eV)(4).

Condensates in quantum chromodynamics and the cosmological constant	10.1073/pnas.1010113107	Casher and Susskind [Casher A, Susskind L (1974) Phys Rev 9:436-460] have noted that in the light-front description, spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is a property of hadronic wavefunctions and not of the vacuum. Here we show from several physical perspectives that, because of color confinement, quark and gluon condensates in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are associated with the internal dynamics of hadrons. We discuss condensates using condensed matter analogues, the Anti de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, and the Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson-Schwinger approach for bound states. Our analysis is in agreement with the Casher and Susskind model and the explicit demonstration of ``in-hadron{''} condensates by Roberts and coworkers [Maris P, Roberts CD, Tandy PC (1998) Phys Lett B 420:267-273], using the Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson-Schwinger formalism for QCD-bound states. These results imply that QCD condensates give zero contribution to the cosmological constant, because all of the gravitational effects of the in-hadron condensates are already included in the normal contribution from hadron masses.

Horizons and singularity in Clifton's spherical solution of f(R) vacuum		Due to the failure of Birkhoff's theorem, black holes in f(R) gravity theories in which an effective time-varying cosmological ``constant{''} is present are, in general, dynamical. Clifton's exact spherical solution of R1+delta gravity, which is dynamical and describes a central object embedded in a spatially flat universe, is studied.

Lessons from classical gravity about the quantum structure of spacetime	10.1088/1742-6596/306/1/012001	I present the theoretical evidence which suggests that gravity is an emergent phenomenon like gas dynamics or elasticity with the gravitational field equations having the same status as, say, the equations of fluid dynamics/elasticity. This paradigm views a wide class of gravitational theories - including Einstein's theory - as describing the thermodynamic limit of the statistical mechanics of `atoms of spacetime'. Strong internal evidence in favour of such a point of view is presented using the classical features of the gravitational theories with just one quantum mechanical input, viz, the existence of Davies-Unruh temperature of horizons. I discuss several conceptual ingredients of this approach.	"5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP DICE2010: SPACE-TIME-MATTER - CURRENT ISSUES

Cosmic magnetic fields and dark energy in extended electromagnetism	10.1088/1742-6596/314/1/012089	We discuss an extended version of electromagnetism in which the usual gauge fixing term is promoted into a physical contribution that introduces a new scalar state in the theory. This new state can be generated from vacuum quantum fluctuations during an inflationary era and, on super-Hubble scales, gives rise to an effective cosmological constant. The value of such a cosmological constant coincides with the one inferred from observations as long as inflation took place at the electroweak scale. On the other hand, the new state also generates an effective electric charge density on sub-Hubble scales that produces both vorticity and magnetic fields with coherent lengths as large as the present Hubble horizon.

New Horizons in Gravity: Dark Energy and Condensate Stars	10.1088/1742-6596/314/1/012010	Black holes are an apparently unavoidable prediction of classical General Relativity, at least if matter obeys the strong energy condition rho + 3p >= 0. However quantum vacuum fluctuations generally violate this condition, as does the eq. of state of cosmological dark energy rho = -p > 0. When quantum effects are considered, black holes lead to a number of thermodynamic paradoxes associated with the Hawking temperature and assumption of black hole entropy, which are briefly reviewed. It is argued that the largest quantum effects arise from the conformal scalar degrees of freedom generated by the trace anomaly of the stress-energy tensor in curved space. At event horizons these can have macroscopically large backreaction effects on the geometry, potentially removing the classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, replacing them with a quantum phase boundary layer, where the effective value of the gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory including the quantum effects of the anomaly, the cosmological term A becomes a dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon boundary conditions at the horizon. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully collapsed star, the effective cosmological term removes any singularity, replacing it with a smooth dark energy de Sitter interior. The resulting gravitational vacuum condensate star (or gravastar) configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes, and provides a testable alternative to black holes as the final quantum mechanical end state of complete gravitational collapse. The observed Lambda(eff) dark energy of our universe likewise may be a macroscopic finite size effect whose value depends not on Planck scale or other microphysics but on the cosmological Hubble horizon scale itself.

Vacuum Solitons with a de Sitter Center as Dark Matter Candidates	10.1134/S0202289311010087	We outline the properties and possible observational signatures of gravitational vacuum solitons (G-lumps) which are spherically symmetric, globally neutral, gravitationally bound compact vacuum objects without horizons, asymptotically de Sitter at the center. Their existence is implied by the Einstein equations. Their masses are restricted by m < m(crit), where m(crit) = alpha m(Pl)root rho(0)/rho(Pl) with a coefficient alpha depending on the model. G-lumps can be considered as dark matter candidates which are generically related to vacuum dark energy through the de Sitter vacuum trapped inside.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY
Supernova Cosmology: Legacy and Future	10.1146/annurev-nucl-102010-130434	The discovery of dark energy by the first generation of high-redshift supernova surveys has generated enormous interest beyond cosmology and has dramatic implications for fundamental physics. Distance measurements using supernova explosions are the most direct probes of the expansion history of the universe, making them extremely useful tools with which to study the cosmic fabric and the properties of gravity at the largest scales. The past decade has seen confirmation of the original results. Type Ia supernovae are among the leading techniques to obtain high-precision measurements of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and, in the near future, its time dependence. The success of these efforts depends on our ability to understand a large number of effects, mostly of an astrophysical nature, that influence the observed flux at Earth. The frontier now lies in understanding whether the observed phenomenon is due to vacuum energy, despite its unnatural density, or some exotic new physics. Future surveys will address the systematic effects with improved calibration procedures and will provide thousands of supernovae for detailed studies.	
Cylindrically Symmetric Scalar Field and it's Lyapunov stability in General Relativity	10.1007/s10773-010-0509-9	In this paper we found an Exact solution for massless scalar field with cosmological constant. This exact solution generalized the Levi-Civita vacuum solution Levi-Civita (Rend. Acc. Lincei 27:183, 1917) to a massless scalar field, with a cosmological constant term. This solution in the absence of the Cosmological constant recovers the spacetime of a massless scalar field with cylindrical symmetry (Buchdahl metric (Buchdahl in Phys. Rev. 115:1325, 1959)). Also if the scalar field disappears, the spacetime will be a representation of de-Sitter space. We prove that the form of the metric's function which was purposed in Momeni and Miraghaei (Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 24(31):5991, 2009) is valid even if we assume a general form. Furthermore we show that in which conditions this solution satisfies energy conditions. Finally the credibility of focusing theorem is proved.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Dynamics of false vacuum bubbles in Brans-Dicke theory	10.1088/1475-7516/2011/01/005	We study the dynamics of false vacuum bubbles in the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity by using the thin shell or thin wall approximation. We consider a false vacuum bubble that has a different value for the Brans-Dicke field between the inside false vacuum region and the outside true vacuum region. Within a certain limit of field values, the difference of field values makes the effective tension of the shell negative. This allows new expanding false vacuum bubbles to be seen by the outside observer, which are disallowed in Einstein gravity.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Cosmologies with a time dependent vacuum	10.1088/1742-6596/283/1/012033	The idea that the cosmological term A should be a time dependent quantity in cosmology is a most natural one. It is difficult to conceive an expanding universe with a strictly constant vacuum energy density, rho(Lambda) = Lambda/(8 pi G), namely one that has remained immutable since the origin of time. A smoothly evolving vacuum energy density rho(Lambda) = rho(Lambda)(xi(t)) that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological functions xi = xi(t), such as the Hubble rate H(t) or the scale factor a(t), is not only a qualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested by fundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (QFT) in curved space-time. To implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to ad hoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessence formulations and the like). A ``running{''} A term can be expected on very similar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings and masses with a physical energy scale in QFT. Furthermore, the experimental evidence that the equation of state (EOS) of the dark energy (DE) could be evolving with time/redshift (including the possibility that it might currently behave phantom-like) suggests that a time variable Lambda = Lambda(t) term (possibly accompanied by a variable Newton's gravitational coupling too, G = G (t)) could account in a natural way for all these features. Remarkably enough, a class of these models (the ``new cosmon{''}) could even be the clue for solving the old cosmological constant problem, including the coincidence problem.

Quantization leading to a natural flattening of the axion potential	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.125035	Starting from the general cosine form for the axion effective potential, we quantize the axion and show that the result is described by a naturally flat potential, if interactions with other particles are not considered. This feature therefore restores the would-be Goldstone-boson nature of the axion, and we calculate the corresponding vacuum energy density, which does not need to be too large by orders of magnitude compared to dark energy.

Naturally minute quantum correction to the cosmological constant descended from the hierarchy	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.126012	We demonstrate that a naturally small quantum correction, or the Casimir energy, to the cosmological constant can arise from a massive bulk fermion field in the Randall-Sundrum model. Under the assumption that the ground value of four-dimensional effective cosmological constant is zero, which can only be attained by some other means, we show that its quantum correction originated from the Casimir energy, that is the vacuum energy associated with the nontrivial topology of the extra dimension, can be as small as the observed dark energy scale without fine-tuning of the bulk fermion mass. To ensure the stabilization of the system, we discuss two stabilization mechanisms under this setup. It is found that the Goldberger-Wise mechanism can be successfully introduced in the presence of a massive bulk fermion, without spoiling the smallness of the quantum correction.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN JORDAN-EINSTEIN FRAMES AND PALATINI-METRIC FORMALISMS	10.1142/S0217732310034456	We discuss the conformal symmetry between Jordan and Einstein frames considering their relations with the metric and Palatini formalisms for modified gravity. Appropriate conformal transformations are taken in to account leading to the evident connection between the gravitational actions in the two mentioned frames and the Hilbert-Einstein action with a cosmological constant. We show that the apparent differences between Palatini and metric formalisms strictly depend on the representation while the number of degrees of freedom is preserved.

Considering the example of how macroscopic quantum electrodynamic fields alter the vacuum structure, we find that the energy scale 1 meV 1 eV is particularly interesting. We discuss how dark energy of this form is accessible to laboratory experiments.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
The volume of the past light-cone and the Paneitz operator	10.1007/s10714-010-1014-4	We study a conjecture involving the invariant volume of the past light-cone from an arbitrary observation point back to a fixed initial value surface. The conjecture is that a fourth order differential operator which occurs in the theory of conformal anomalies gives 8 pi when acted upon the invariant volume of the past light-cone. We show that an extended version of the conjecture is valid for an arbitrary homogeneous and isotropic geometry. First order perturbation theory about flat spacetime reveals a violation of the conjecture which, however, vanishes for any vacuum solution of the Einstein equation. These results may be significant for constructing quantum gravitational observables, for quantifying the back-reaction on spacetime expansion and for alternate gravity models which feature a timelike vector field.

ON THE EFFECTIVE EQUATION OF STATE OF DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0218271810018402	In an effective field theory model with an ultraviolet momentum cutoff, there is a relation between the effective equation-of-state of dark energy and the ultraviolet cutoff scale. It implies that a measure of the equation of state of dark energy different from minus one, omega not equal -1, does not rule out vacuum energy as dark energy. It also indicates an interesting possibility that precise measurements of the infrared properties of dark energy can be used to probe the ultraviolet cutoff scale of effective quantum field theory coupled to gravity. In a toy model with a vacuum energy-dominated universe with a Planck scale cutoff, the dark energy effective equation of state is w(eff) approximate to -0.96.

Physical Vacuum in Superconductors	10.1007/s10948-010-0793-x	Although experiments carried out by Jain et al. showed that the Cooper pairs obey the strong equivalence principle, The measurement of the Cooper pairs inertial mass by Tate et al. revealed an anomalous excess of mass. In the present paper, we interpret these experimental results in the framework of an electromagnetic model of dark energy for the superconductors' vacuum. We argue that this physical vacuum is associated with a preferred frame. Ultimately from the conservation of energy for Cooper pairs, we derive a model for a variable vacuum speed of light in the superconductors physical vacuum in relation with a possible breaking of the weak equivalence principle for Cooper pairs.

Coupled quintessence with a possible transient accelerating phase	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.103527	We discuss some cosmological consequences of a general model of coupled quintessence in which the phenomenological coupling between the cold dark matter and dark energy is a function of the cosmic scale factor epsilon(a). This class of models presents cosmological solutions in which the Universe is currently dominated by an exotic component, but will eventually be dominated by cold dark matter in the future. This dynamical behavior is considerably different from the standard ACDM evolution, and may alleviate some conflicts in reconciling the idea of the dark energy-dominated universe with observables in String/M theory. Finally, we investigate some observational features of this model and discuss some constraints on its parameters from current Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.

Gauge fields and ghosts in Rindler space	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.103520	We consider a two-dimensional Maxwell system defined on the Rindler space with metric ds(2) = exp(2a xi).(d eta(2) - d xi(2)) with the goal to study the dynamics of the ghosts. We find an extra contribution to the vacuum energy in comparison with Minkowski space-time with metric ds(2) = dt(2) - dx(2). This extra contribution can be traced to the unphysical degrees of freedom (in Minkowski space). The technical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's coefficients which mix the positive-and negative-frequency modes. The corresponding mixture cannot be avoided because the projections to positive-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive-frequency modes with respect to the Rindler observer's proper time eta are not equivalent. The exact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in Minkowski space cannot hold in the Rindler space. In the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) approach this effect manifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts. An inertial observer in Minkowski vacuum vertical bar 0 > observes a universe with no net BRST charge only as a result of cancellation between the two. However, the Rindler observers who do not ever have access to the entire space-time would see a net BRST charge. In this respect the effect resembles the Unruh effect. The effect is infrared (IR) in nature, and sensitive to the horizon and/or boundaries. We interpret the extra energy as the formation of the ``ghost condensate{''} when the ghost degrees of freedom cannot propagate, but nevertheless do contribute to the vacuum energy. Exact computations in this simple two-dimensional model support the claim made in a previous paper [F. R. Urban and A. R. Zhitnitsky, Nucl. Phys. B835, 135 (2010).] that the ghost contribution might be responsible for the observed dark energy in a four-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy, antimatter gravity and geometry of the Universe	10.1007/s10509-010-0387-x	This article is based on two hypotheses. The first one is the existence of the gravitational repulsion between particles and antiparticles. Consequently, virtual particle-antiparticle pairs in the quantum vacuum might be considered as gravitational dipoles. The second hypothesis is that the Universe has geometry of a four-dimensional hyper-spherical shell with thickness equal to the Compton wavelength of a pion, which is a simple generalization of the usual geometry of a 3-hypersphere. It is striking that these two hypotheses lead to a simple relation for the gravitational mass density of the vacuum, which is in very good agreement with the observed dark energy density. It might be a sign that QCD fields provide the largest contribution to the gravitational mass of the physical vacuum; contrary to the prediction of the Standard Model that QCD contribution is much smaller than some other contributions.

Dark energy as a manifestation of the non-constant cosmological constant	10.1007/s10509-010-0347-5	We propose a time-varying cosmological constant with a fixed equation of state, which evolves mainly through its interaction with the background during most of the long history of the universe. However, such an interaction does not exist in the very early- and the late-time universe and this produces the acceleration during these eras when it becomes very nearly a constant. It is found that after the initial inflationary phase, the cosmological constant, which we call the lambda parameter, rolls down from a large constant value to another but very small constant value and further dominates the present epoch showing up in the form of dark energy, driving the acceleration.

FRW universe in HorI integral ava gravity	10.1007/s10509-010-0346-6	Recently, a field theoretic model for a UV complete theory of gravity has been proposed by HorI integral ava. This theory is a non-relativistic renormalizable gravity theory which coincides with Einstein's general relativity at large distances. Subsequently Lu et al. have formulated the modified Friedmann equations and have presented a solution in vacuum. In the present work, we rewrite the modified FRW equations in the form of usual FRW equations in Einstein gravity and consequences have been analyzed. Also the thermodynamics of the FRW universe has been studied.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Some Bianchi type cosmological models in f(R) gravity	10.1007/s10509-010-0371-5	The modified theories of gravity, especially the f(R) gravity, have attracted much attention in the last decade. In this context, we study the exact vacuum solutions of Bianchi type I, III and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes in the metric version of f(R) gravity. The field equations are solved by taking expansion scalar theta proportional to shear scalar sigma which gives A=B (n) , where A and B are the metric coefficients. The physical behavior of the solutions has been discussed using some physical quantities. Also, the function of the Ricci scalar is evaluated in each case.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Non-vacuum Bianchi types I and V in f (R) gravity	10.1007/s10714-010-1005-5	In a recent paper (Sharif and Shamir in Class. Quantum Grav. 26:235020, 2009), we have studied the vacuum solutions of Bianchi types I and V spacetimes in the framework of metric f (R) gravity. Here we extend this work to perfect fluid solutions. For this purpose, we take stiff matter to find energy density and pressure of the universe. In particular, we find two exact solutions in each case which correspond to two models of the universe. The first solution gives a singular model while the second solution provides a non-singular model. The physical behavior of these models has been discussed using some physical quantities. Also, the function of the Ricci scalar is evaluated.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
New Classes of Off-Diagonal Cosmological Solutions in Einstein Gravity	10.1007/s10773-010-0468-1	In this work, we apply the anholonomic deformation method for constructing new classes of anisotropic cosmological solutions in Einstein gravity and/or generalizations with nonholonomic variables. There are analyzed four types of, in general, inhomogeneous metrics, defined with respect to anholonomic frames and their main geometric properties. Such spacetimes contain as particular cases certain conformal and/or frame transforms of the well known Friedman-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi, Kasner and Godel universes and define a great variety of cosmological models with generic off-diagonal metrics, local anisotropy and inhomogeneity. It is shown that certain nonholonomic gravitational configurations may mimic de Sitter like inflation scenarios and different anisotropic modifications without satisfying any classical false-vacuum equation of state. Finally, we speculate on perspectives when such off-diagonal solutions can be related to dark energy and dark matter problems in modern cosmology.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Comments on the vacuum energy decay	10.1088/1475-7516/2010/11/043	The instability of vacuum energy in de Sitter space as discussed recently by Polyakov is argued to be a generic feature when external gravitational fields are present. It is related to the existence of forbidden (by momentum conservation) decays derived in some detail by Bros, Epstein and Moschella. Some calculations are discussed in a conformally invariant setting, and a flat space model is presented.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Hydrodynamic Vacuum Sources of Dark Matter Self-Generation in an Accelerating Universe Without a Big Bang	10.1134/S106377611011004X	We have obtained a generalization of the hydrodynamic theory of vacuum in the context of general relativity. While retaining the Lagrangian character of general relativity, the new theory provides a natural alternative to the view that the singularity is inevitable in general relativity and the theory of a hot Universe. We show that the macroscopic source-sink motion as a whole of ordinary (dark) matter that emerges during the production of particles out of the vacuum can be a new source of gravitational vacuum polarization (determining the variability of the cosmological term in general relativity). We have removed the well-known problems of the cosmological constant by refining the physical nature of dark energy associated precisely with this hydrodynamically initiated variability of the vacuum energy density. A new exact solution of the modified general relativity equations that contains no free (fitting) parameter additional to those available in general relativity has been obtained. It corresponds to the continuous and metric-affecting production of ultralight dark matter particles (with mass m(0) = ((h) over bar /c(2)) root 12 rho(0)k approximate to 3 x 10(-66) g, k is the gravitational constant) out of the vacuum, with its density rho(0), constant during the exponential expansion of a spatially flat Universe, being retained. This solution is shown to be stable in the regime of cosmological expansion in the time interval -infinity < t < t(max), when t = 0 corresponds to the present epoch and t(max) = 2/3H(0)c Omega(0m) approximate to 38 x 10(9) yr at Omega(0m) = rho(0)/(rho c) approximate to 0.28 (H-0 is the Hubble constant, rho(c) is the critical density). For t > t(max), the solution becomes exponentially unstable and characterizes the inverse process of dark matter particle absorption by the vacuum in the regime of contraction of the Universe. We consider the admissibility of the fact that scalar massive photon pairs can be these dark matter particles. Good quantitative agreement of this exact solution with the cosmological observations of SnIa, SDSS-BAO, and the decrease in the acceleration of the expansion of the Universe has been obtained.

Dark energy crisis	10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2010.05.043	In cosmology we are facing the dark energy crisis: How can we survive huge vacuum energy, meanwhile living with tiny dark energy? For the solution to this crisis, we raise several clues and hints, in particular, supersymmetry and the double hierarchy, M(P)-M(SM)-M(DE) (Planck-Standard Model-dark energy scales). These two clues naturally lead to a solution with a supersymmetry-breaking brane-world. The train of thought from the clues to the solution is elucidated.	NUCLEAR PHYSICS A
GAUGE THEORY OF GRAVITY WITH DE SITTER SYMMETRY AS A SOLUTION TO THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PROBLEM AND THE DARK ENERGY PUZZLE	10.1142/S0217732310034274	We propose a solution to the longstanding cosmological constant (CC) problem which is based on the fusion of two existing concepts.The first is the suggestion that the proper description of classical gravitational effects is the gauge theory of gravity in which the connection instead of the metric acts as the dynamical variable.The resulting field equation does not then contain the CC term. This removes the connection between the CC and the quantum vacuum energy, and therefore addresses the old CC problem of why quantum vacuum energy does not gravitate.The CC-equivalent in this approach arises from the constant of integration when reducing the field equation to the Einstein equation.The second is the assumption that the universe obeys de Sitter symmetry, with the observed accelerating expansion as its manifestation. We combine these ideas and identify the constant of integration with the inverse-square of the radius of curvature of the de Sitter space. The origin of dark energy (DE) is therefore associated with the inherent spacetime geometry, with the smallness of DE protected by symmetry. This addresses the new CC problem, or the DE puzzle. This approach, however, faces major challenges from quantum considerations. These are the ghost problem associated with higher order gravity theories and the quantum instability of the de Sitter spacetime. We discuss their possible remedies.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Spherical collapse model in time varying vacuum cosmologies	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.083512	We investigate the virialization of cosmic structures in the framework of flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, in which the vacuum energy density evolves with time. In particular, our analysis focuses on the study of spherical matter perturbations, as they decouple from the background expansion, ``turn around,'' and finally collapse. We generalize the spherical collapse model in the case when the vacuum energy is a running function of the Hubble rate, Lambda = Lambda(H). A particularly well-motivated model of this type is the so-called quantum field vacuum, in which Lambda(H) is a quadratic function, Lambda(H) = n(0) + n(2)H(2), with n(0) not equal 0. This model was previously studied by our team using the latest high quality cosmological data to constrain its free parameters, as well as the predicted cluster formation rate. It turns out that the corresponding Hubble expansion history resembles that of the traditional Lambda CDM cosmology. We use this Lambda(t)CDM framework to illustrate the fact that the properties of the spherical collapse model (virial density, collapse factor, etc.) depend on the choice of the considered vacuum energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular, if the distribution of the vacuum energy is clustered, then, under specific conditions, we can produce more concentrated structures with respect to the homogeneous vacuum energy case.

EFFECTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD ON THE DYNAMICS OF BIANCHI TYPE VI0 UNIVERSE WITH ANISOTROPIC DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0218271810018165	Spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type VI0 cosmological models with cosmological constant are investigated in the presence of anisotropic dark energy. We examine the effects of electromagnetic field on the dynamics of the universe and anisotropic behavior of dark energy. The law of variation of the mean Hubble parameter is used to find exact solutions of the Einstein field equations. We find that electromagnetic field promotes anisotropic behavior of dark energy which becomes isotropic for future evolution. It is concluded that the isotropic behavior of the universe model is seen even in the presence of electromagnetic field and anisotropic fluid.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D

Trace anomaly, massless scalars, and the gravitational coupling of QCD	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.064023	The anomalous effective action describing the coupling of gravity to a non-Abelian gauge theory can be determined by a variational solution of the anomaly equation, as shown by Riegert long ago. It is given by a nonlocal expression, with the nonlocal interaction determined by the Green's function of a conformally covariant operator of fourth order. In recent works it has been shown that this interaction is mediated by a simple pole in an expansion around a Minkowski background, coupled in the infrared in the massless fermion limit. This result relies on the local formulation of the original action in terms of two auxiliary fields, one physical scalar and one ghost, which take the role of massless composite degrees of freedom. In the gravity case, the two scalars have provided ground in favor of some recent proposals of an infrared approach to the solution of the dark energy problem, entirely based on the behavior of the vacuum energy at the QCD phase transition. As a test of this general result, we perform a complete one-loop computation of the effective action describing the coupling of a non-Abelian gauge theory to gravity. We confirm the appearance of an anomaly pole which contributes to the trace part of the TJJ correlator and of extra poles in its trace-free part, in the quark and gluon sectors, describing the coupling of the energy-momentum tensor (T) to two non-Abelian gauge currents (J).

NEW HORIZONS IN GRAVITY: THE TRACE ANOMALY, DARK ENERGY AND CONDENSATE STARS		General Relativity receives quantum corrections relevant at macroscopic distance scales and near event horizons. These arise from the conformal scalar degrees of freedom in the extended effective field theory of gravity generated by the trace anomaly of massless quantum fields in curved space. The origin of these conformal scalar degrees of freedom as massless poles in two-particle intermediate states of anomalous amplitudes in flat space is exposed. These are non-local quantum pair correlated states, not present in the classical theory. At event horizons the conformal anomaly scalar degrees of freedom can have macroscopically large effects on the geometry, potentially removing the classical event horizon of black hole and cosmological spacetimes, replacing them with a quantum boundary layer where the effective value of the gravitational vacuum energy density can change. In the effective theory, the cosmological term becomes a dynamical condensate, whose value depends upon boundary conditions near the horizon. In the conformal phase where the anomaly induced fluctuations dominate, and the condensate dissolves, the effective cosmological ``constant{''} is a running coupling which has an infrared stable fixed point at zero. By taking a positive value in the interior of a fully collapsed star, the effective cosmological term removes any singularity, replacing it with a smooth dark energy interior. The resulting gravitational condensate star configuration resolves all black hole paradoxes, and provides a testable alternative to black holes as the final state of complete gravitational collapse. The observed dark energy of our universe likewise may be a macroscopic finite size effect whose value depends not on microphysics but on the cosmological horizon scale. The physical arguments and detailed calculations involving the trace anomaly effective action, auxiliary scalar fields and stress tensor in various situations and backgrounds supporting this hypothesis are reviewed. Originally delivered as a series of lectures at the Krakow School, the paper is pedagogical in style, and wide ranging in scope, collecting and presenting a broad spectrum of results on black holes, the trace anomaly, and quantum effects in cosmology.

Dark energy domination in the Virgocentric flow	10.1051/0004-6361/201014912	Context. The standard Delta CDM cosmological model implies that all celestial bodies are embedded in a perfectly uniform dark energy background, represented by Einstein's cosmological constant, and experience its repulsive antigravity action. Aims. Can dark energy have strong dynamical effects on small cosmic scales as well as globally? Continuing our efforts to clarify this question, we now focus on the Virgo Cluster and the flow of expansion around it. Methods. We interpret the Hubble diagram from a new database of velocities and distances of galaxies in the cluster and its environment, using a nonlinear analytical model, which incorporates the antigravity force in terms of Newtonian mechanics. The key parameter is the zero-gravity radius, the distance at which gravity and antigravity are in balance. Results. 1. The interplay between the gravity of the cluster and the antigravity of the dark energy background determines the kinematical structure of the system and controls its evolution. 2. The gravity dominates the quasi-stationary bound cluster, while the antigravity controls the Virgocentric flow, bringing order and regularity to the flow, which reaches linearity and the global Hubble rate at distances greater than or similar to 15 Mpc. 3. The cluster and the flow form a system similar to the Local Group and its outflow. In the velocity-distance diagram, the cluster-flow structure reproduces the group-flow structure with a scaling factor of about 10; the zero-gravity radius for the cluster system is also 10 times larger. Conclusions. The phase and dynamical similarity of the systems on the scales of 1-30 Mpc suggests that a two-component pattern may be universal for groups and clusters: a quasi-stationary bound central component and an expanding outflow around it, caused by the nonlinear gravity-antigravity interplay with the dark energy dominating in the flow component.

Scale Transformation, Modified Gravity, and Brans-Dicke Theory	10.1007/s10773-010-0398-y	A model of Einstein-Hilbert action subject to the scale transformation is studied. By introducing a dilaton field as a means of scale transformation a new action is obtained whose Einstein field equations are consistent with traceless matter with non-vanishing modified terms together with dynamical cosmological and gravitational coupling terms. The obtained modified Einstein equations are neither those in f(R) metric formalism nor the ones in f(R) Palatini formalism, whereas the modified source terms are formally equivalent to those of f(R) = 1/2 R(2) gravity in Palatini formalism. The correspondence between the present model, the modified gravity theory, and Brans-Dicke theory with omega = -3/2 is explicitly shown, provided the dilaton field is condensated to its vacuum state.

Large-scale magnetic fields, dark energy, and QCD	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.043524	Cosmological magnetic fields are being observed with ever increasing correlation lengths, possibly reaching the size of superclusters, therefore disfavoring the conventional picture of generation through primordial seeds later amplified by galaxy-bound dynamo mechanisms. In this paper we put forward a fundamentally different approach that links such large-scale magnetic fields to the cosmological vacuum energy. In our scenario the dark energy is due to the Veneziano ghost (which solves the U(1)(A) problem in QCD). The Veneziano ghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a constant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model. While this interaction does not produce any physical effects in Minkowski space, it triggers the generation of a magnetic field in an expanding universe at every epoch. The induced energy of the magnetic field is thus proportional to cosmological vacuum energy: rho(EM) similar or equal to B-2 similar or equal to (alpha/4 pi)(2)rho(DE), rho(DE) hence acting as a source for the magnetic energy rho(EM). The corresponding numerical estimate leads to a magnitude in the nG range. There are two unique and distinctive predictions of our proposal: an uninterrupted active generation of Hubble size correlated magnetic fields throughout the evolution of the Universe; the presence of parity violation on the enormous scales 1/H, which apparently has been already observed in CMB. These predictions are entirely rooted into the standard model of particle physics.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Shadows of trans-Planckian physics on cosmology and the role of the zero-point energy density	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.043519	We consider the role of the zero-point energy of a quantum field in cosmology and show that the flow of trans-Planckian momenta due to redshift acts as a source for this energy, regularized with a cutoff Lambda in physical momenta. In order to fulfill Bianchi identity, we generalize Einstein equations and discuss the corresponding Friedmann homogeneous and isotropic models. In case of a de Sitter phase, such as during inflation, the solution shows a logarithmic behavior of the Hubble parameter and a primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations characterized by the spectral index n(s) = 1 - Lambda(2)/(3 pi m(P)(2)) with m(P) the Planck mass. We also discuss possible implications of the scenario on the late accelerating stage of the Universe at small redshifts and the emergence of a fluid characterized by an equation of state w = P/rho = -1 + Lambda(2)/(9 pi m(P)(2)). Primordial perturbation spectrum and dark energy parameter w are, thus, predicted to be connected by the simple relation w = -(2 + n(s))/3.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
The QCD nature of dark energy	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2010.04.001	The origin of the observed dark energy could be explained entirely within the standard model, with no new fields required. We show how the low-energy sector of the chiral QCD Lagrangian, once embedded in a non-trivial spacetime, gives rise to a cosmological vacuum energy density which can be presented entirely in terms of QCD parameters and the Hubble constant H as rho(A) similar or equal to H . m(q)<(q) over barq >/m(eta') similar to (4.3 . 10(-3) eV)(4). In this work we focus on the dynamics of the ghost fields that are essential ingredients of the aforementioned Lagrangian. In particular, we argue that the Veneziano ghost, being unphysical in the usual Minkowski QFT, exhibits important physical effects if the universe is expanding. Such effects are naturally very small as they are proportional to the rate of expansion H/Lambda(QCD) similar to 10(-41). The co-existence of these two drastically different scales (Lambda(QCD) similar to 100 MeV and H similar to 10(-33) eV) is a direct consequence of the auxiliary conditions on the physical Hilbert space that are necessary to keep the theory unitary. The exact cancellation taking place in Minkowski space due to this auxiliary condition is slightly violated when the system is upgraded to an expanding background. Nevertheless, this ``tiny{''} effect would in fact the driving force accelerating the universe today. We also derive the time-dependent equation of state w(t) for the dark energy component which tracks the dynamics of the Veneziano ghost in a FLRW universe. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermal processes in ringholes	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.044016	Ringholes are space-time tunnelings connecting two asymptotically flat regions by means of a throat with the topology of a torus. This paper considers the processes of semiclassical thermal emission from ringholes and the accretion of dark energy onto them by adapting the results previously obtained for wormholes to toroidal topology. It is shown that at or near the throat the ringholes can be characterized as a mixture of two thermal sources, one at positive temperature and the other at negative temperature which, respectively, emit usual black body radiation and phantomlike radiation, leading after completion of thermal emission to two possible limiting situations, one similar to a wormhole in that it behaves just like a diverging lens, and the other similar to a black hole in that it behaves only as a converging lens. These two limiting situations, though described at rather diverging sizes, are also the final consequences from the accretion processes of quintessential and phantom vacuum energies. Finally, a brief discussion is added on the ringhole thermodynamics and its associated laws which are nothing but the extension to toroidal geometry from the thermodynamic laws which were recently established for wormholes.

Does Dirac-Born-Infeld modification of quadratic theories really matter?	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.044002	We study the consequences of further modification of f(R, R(mu nu)R(mu nu); R(mu nu sigma rho)R(mu nu sigma rho))/f(R) theories by means of the Dirac-Born-Infeld procedure, which is the replacement of f by lambda(root 1 + 2f/lambda - 1) (the free parameter lambda fixes an additional energy scale). We pay special attention to the definition of masses of the linearized propagating degrees of freedom because they are important to judge the stability of the linearization around vacuum background spaces. In this context we discuss the subtleties associated with expanding f(R, R(mu nu)R(mu nu); R(mu nu sigma rho)R(mu nu sigma rho)) Lagrangians around maximally symmetric spaces of constant curvature, as well as with equivalence of the linearized Lagrangian to a scalar-tensor theory. Investigation of the consequences of applying the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) strategy to further modify quadratic theories on the stability of de Sitter vacuum, as well as its impact on the cosmological dynamics, are the main concern of this paper. We show that (i) although the DBI deformation does not affect the Ostrogradski stability, other important instabilities such as the Ricci and scalar-tachyon ones, may be indeed surmounted (sometimes at the cost of renouncing to the original motivation of the DBI strategy, to avoid singularities), and (ii) DBI transforming the original theory broadens its possibilities to do cosmology since the asymptotic structure of the DBI-dual theory is richer than in the standard case. In particular, either the dimension of the phase space is increased, or there appear bifurcations in the control-parameter space.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D

The induced rotation of elliptical galaxies due to the anti-gravity of the vacuum is found to be 10(-21) s(-1) for real elliptical galaxies. The effect of the vacuum rotation of the entire Universe is discussed, and can be described by the invariant omega (nu) = omega (0) similar to root Gpv. The corresponding numerical angular velocity of the Universe is 10(-19) s(-1), in good agreement with modern data on the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation.	ASTRONOMY REPORTS

Constraints on cold dark matter accelerating cosmologies and cluster formation	10.1103/PhysRevD.82.023504	We discuss the properties of homogeneous and isotropic flat cosmologies in which the present accelerating stage is powered only by the gravitationally induced creation of cold dark matter (CCDM) particles (Omega(m) = 1). For some matter creation rates proposed in the literature, we show that the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the universe, the Hubble expansion rate, the growth factor, and the cluster formation rate are analytically defined. The best CCDM scenario has only one free parameter and our joint analysis involving baryonic acoustic oscillations + cosmic microwave background (CMB) + SNe Ia data yields (Omega) over tilde = 0.28 +/- 0.01 (1 sigma), where (Omega) over tilde (m) is the observed matter density parameter. In particular, this implies that the model has no dark energy but the part of the matter that is effectively clustering is in good agreement with the latest determinations from the large- scale structure. The growth of perturbation and the formation of galaxy clusters in such scenarios are also investigated. Despite the fact that both scenarios may share the same Hubble expansion, we find that matter creation cosmologies predict stronger small scale dynamics which implies a faster growth rate of perturbations with respect to the usual Lambda CDM cosmology. Such results point to the possibility of a crucial observational test confronting CCDM with Lambda CDM scenarios through a more detailed analysis involving CMB, weak lensing, as well as the large-scale structure.

How the charge can affect the formation of gravastars	10.1088/1475-7516/2010/07/029	In recent work we physically interpreted a special gravastar solution characterized by a zero Schwarzschild mass. In fact, in that case, none gravastar was formed and the shell collapsed without forming an event horizon, originating what we called a massive non-gravitational object. This object has two components of non zero mass but the exterior spacetime is de Sitter. One of the component is a massive thin shell and the other one is de Sitter spacetime inside. The total mass of this object is zero Schwarzschild mass, which characterizes an exterior vacuum spacetime. Here, we extend this study to the case where we have a charged shell. Now, the exterior is a Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime and, depending on the parameter omega = 1 - gamma of the equation of state of the shell, and the charge, a gravastar structure can be formed. We have found that the presence of the charge contributes to the stability of the gravastar, if the charge is greater than a critical value. Otherwise, a massive non-gravitational object is formed for small charges.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Phantom and inflation scenarios from a 5D vacuum through form-invariance transformations of the Einstein equations	10.1393/ncb/i2010-10888-0	We study phantom and inflationary cosmologies using form-invariance transformations of the Einstein equations with respect to p, 11, a and p, from a 5D vacuum.

Time variable cosmological constants from the age of universe	10.1016/j.physletb.2010.05.058	In this Letter, time variable cosmological constant, dubbed age cosmological constant, is investigated motivated by the fact: any cosmological length scale and time scale can introduce a cosmological constant or vacuum energy density into Einstein's theory. The age cosmological constant takes the form rho(A) = 3c(2)M(P)(2)/t(A)(2), where t(A) is the age or conformal age of our universe. The effective equation of state (EoS) of age cosmological constant are w(A)(eff) = -1 + 2/3 root Omega A/c and w(A)(eff) = -1 + 2/3 root Omega A/c(1+z) when the age and conformal age of universe are taken as the role of cosmological time scales respectively. The EoS are the same as the so-called agegraphic dark energy models. However, the evolution histories are different from the agegraphic ones for their different evolution equations.

The Role of Energy Conservation and Vacuum Energy in the Evolution of the Universe	10.1007/s10699-010-9172-0	We discuss a new theory of the universe in which the vacuum energy is of classical origin and dominates the energy content of the universe. As usual, the Einstein equations determine the metric of the universe. However, the scale factor is controlled by total energy conservation in contrast to the practice in the Robertson-Walker formulation. This theory naturally leads to an explanation for the Big Bang and is not plagued by the horizon and cosmological constant problem. It naturally accommodates the notion of dark energy and proposes a possible explanation for dark matter. It leads to a dual description of the universe, which is reminiscent of the dual theory proposed by Milne in 1937. On the one hand one can describe the universe in terms of the original Einstein coordinates in which the universe is expanding, on the other hand one can describe it in terms of co-moving coordinates which feature in measurements. In the latter representation the universe looks stationary and the age of the universe appears constant. The paper describes the evolution of this universe. It starts out in a classical state with perfect symmetry and zero entropy. Due to the vacuum metric the effective energy density is infinite at the beginning, but diminishes rapidly. Once it reaches the Planck energy density of elementary particles, the formation of particles can commence. Because of the quantum nature of creation and annihilation processes spatial and temporal inhomogeneities appear in the matter distributions, resulting in residual proton (neutron) and electron densities. Hence, quantum uncertainty plays an essential role in the creation of a diversified complex universe with increasing entropy. It thus seems that quantum fluctuations play a role in cosmology similar to that of random mutations in biology. Other analogies to biological principles, such as recapitulation, are also discussed.

Late time cosmic acceleration of a flat matter dominated universe with constant vacuum energy		Matter and radiation densities are compared with a constant vacuum energy density of positive cosmological constant, from a few seconds of the universe till the present epoch. Epoch of acceleration is calculated by estimating baryonic density from consideration of finite thickness of last scattering surface and dark matter density from inflationary flatness condition. The calculated epoch of acceleration is found to be in good agreement with recent supernova observations.	INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Curing singularities in cosmological evolution of F(R) gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2010/06/005	We study F(R) modified gravity models which are capable of driving the accelerating epoch of the Universe at the present time whilst not destroying the standard Big Bang and inflationary cosmology. Recent studies have shown that a weak curvature singularity with vertical bar R vertical bar -> infinity can arise generically in viable F(R) models of present dark energy (DE) signaling an internal incompleteness of these models. In this work we study how this problem is cured by adding a quadratic correction with a sufficiently small coefficient to the F(R) function at large curvatures. At the same time, this correction eliminates two more serious problems of previously constructed viable F(R) DE models: unboundedness of the mass of a scalar particle (scalaron) arising in F(R) gravity and the scalaron overabundance problem. Such carefully constructed models can also yield both an early time inflationary epoch and a late time de Sitter phase with vastly different values of R. The reheating epoch in these combined models of primordial and present dark energy is completely different from that of the old R + R-2/6M(2) inflationary model, mainly due to the fact that values of the effective gravitational constant at low and intermediate curvatures are different for positive and negative R. This changes the number of e-folds during the observable part of inflation that results in a different value of the primordial power spectrum index.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
A new look at old inflationary theory	10.4006/1.3425751	Our theory of the origins of the universe based on old inflationary theory makes the minimum of assumptions, yet is consistent with observations. The properties of the scalar field, the discrete nonsymmetric phase, and their interactions are examined. Immediate consequences are that regions of the new phase never merge but persist as islands in the scalar field, and that the persistent scalar field is responsible for the effects attributed to cold dark matter.

CONSTRAINTS ON THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT DUE TO SCALE INVARIANCE	10.1142/S0217732310032561	We consider the standard model with local scale invariance. The theory shows exact scale invariance of dimensionally regulated action. We show that massless gauge fields, which may be Abelian or non-Abelian, lead to vanishing contribution to the cosmological constant in this theory. This result follows in the quantum theory, to all orders in the gauge couplings. However, we have not considered contributions higher orders in the gravitational coupling. Similarly we also find that massless fermion fields yield null contribution to the cosmological constant. The effective cosmological constant in this theory is nonzero due to the phenomenon of cosmological symmetry breaking, which also gives masses to all the massive fields, besides generating the Planck mass. We find a simple relationship between the curvature scalar and the vacuum value of the Higgs field in the limit when we ignore all other contributions to the energy density besides the vacuum energy.

Cosmic perturbations with running G and Lambda	10.1088/0264-9381/27/10/105004	Cosmologies with running cosmological term rho(Lambda) and gravitational Newton's coupling G may naturally be expected if the evolution of the universe can ultimately be derived from the first principles of quantum field theory or string theory. For example, if matter is conserved and the vacuum energy density varies quadratically with the expansion rate as rho(Lambda)(H) = n(0) + n(2) H(2), with n(0) not equal 0 (a possibility that has been advocated in the literature within the QFT framework), it can be shown that G must vary logarithmically (hence very slowly) with H. In this paper, we derive the general cosmological perturbation equations for models with variable G and rho(Lambda) in which the fluctuations delta G and delta rho(Lambda) are explicitly included. We demonstrate that if matter is covariantly conserved, the late growth of matter density perturbations is independent of the wavenumber k. Furthermore, if rho(Lambda) is negligible at high redshifts and G varies slowly, we find that these cosmologies produce a matter power spectrum with the same shape as that of the Lambda CDM model, thus predicting the same basic features on structure formation. Despite this shape indistinguishability, the free parameters of the variable G and rho(Lambda) models can still be effectively constrained from the observational bounds on the spectrum amplitude.

PLANE SYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS IN f(R) GRAVITY	10.1142/S0217732310032536	The modified theories of gravity, especially the f(R) theory, have attracted much attention in recent years. In this context, we explore static plane symmetric vacuum solutions using the metric approach of this theory. The field equations are solved using the assumption of constant scalar curvature which may be zero or nonzero. We have found a total of three plane symmetric solutions. The correspondence of these solutions with the well-known solutions in General Relativity is given.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Five-dimensional Brans-Dicke M (1)xR (3)xS (1) cosmology with chameleon scalar field	10.1007/s10509-010-0281-6	We investigate five-dimensional Brans-Dicke cosmology with spacetime described by the homogeneous, anisotropic and flat spacetime with the topology M (1)xR (3)xS (1) where S (1) is taken in the form of a circle. We conjecture throughout this letter that the extra-dimension compactifies as the visible dimensions expand like b(t)a parts per thousand a (-1)(t) and that the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and the matter is of the form f(phi)ae phi (2). The model gives rise to a transition from a decelerated epoch to an accelerated epoch for large values of the Brans-Dicke parameter omega. The model predicts crossing of the phantom divided barrier unless the universe is governed by a growing matter field.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Gravitational coupling and dynamical reduction of the cosmological constant	10.1007/s10714-009-0903-x	We introduce a dynamical model to reduce a large cosmological constant to a sufficiently small value. The basic ingredient in this model is a distinction which has been made between the two unit systems used in cosmology and particle physics. We have used a conformal invariant gravitational model to define a particular conformal frame in terms of large scale properties of the universe. It is then argued that the contributions of mass scales in particle physics to the vacuum energy density should be considered in a different conformal frame. In this manner, a decaying mechanism is presented in which the conformal factor appears as a dynamical field and plays a key role to relax a large effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we argue that this model also provides a possible explanation for the coincidence problem.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION

In the limiting case of a flat universe, i.e. k=0, all results given in GO model are obtained.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Phantom Boundary Crossing and Anomalous Growth Index of Fluctuations in Viable f(R) Models of Cosmic Acceleration		The evolution of a background space-time metric and subhorizon matter density perturbations in the Universe is numerically analyzed in viable f (R) models of present dark energy and cosmic acceleration. It is found that viable models generically exhibit recent crossing of the phantom boundary W-DE = -1. Furthermore, it is shown that, as a consequence of the anomalous growth of density perturbations during the end of the matter-dominated stage, their growth index evolves nonmonotonically with time and may even become negative temporarily.

THE TRACE ANOMALY AND DYNAMICAL VACUUM ENERGY IN COSMOLOGY	10.1142/S0217751X10049670	The trace anomaly of conformal matter implies the existence of massless scalar poles in physical amplitudes involving the stress-energy tensor. These poles may be described by a local effective action with massless scalarfields, which couple to classical sources, contribute to gravitational scattering processes, and can have long range gravitational effects at macroscopic scales. In an effective field theory approach, the effective action of the anomaly is an infrared relevant term that should be added to the Einstein-Hilbert action of classical General Relativity to take account of macroscopic quantum effects. The additional scalar degrees of freedom contained in this effective action may be und erstood as responsible for both the Casimir effect in at spacetime and large quantum backreaction effects at the horizon scale of cosmological spacetimes. These effects of the trace anomaly imply that the cosmological vacuum energy is dynamical, and its value depends on macroscopic boundary conditions at the cosmological horizon scale, rather than sensitivity to the extreme ultraviolet Planck scale.

The cosmological constant from the QCD Veneziano ghost	10.1016/j.physletb.2010.03.080	We suggest that the solution to the cosmological vacuum energy puzzle is linked to the infrared sector of the effective theory of gravity interacting with standard model fields, with QCD fields specifically. We work in the framework of low energy quantum gravity as an effective field theory. In particular, we compute the vacuum energy in terms of QCD parameters and the Hubble constant H such that the vacuum energy is epsilon(vac) similar to H . m(q)<(q) over barq >/m(eta') (3.6 . 10(-3) eV)(4), which is amazingly close to the observed value today. The QCD ghost (responsible for the solution of the U(1)(A) problem) plays a crucial role in the computation of the vacuum energy, because the ghost's properties at very large but finite distances slightly deviate (as similar to H/Lambda(QCD)) from their infinite volume Minkowski values. Another important prediction of this framework states that the vacuum energy owes its existence to the asymmetry of the cosmos. Indeed, this effect is a direct consequence of the embedding of our Universe on a non-trivial manifold such as a torus with (slightly) different linear sizes. Such a violation of cosmological isotropy is apparently indeed supported by WMAP, and will be confirmed (or ruled out) by future PLANCK data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stress-energy tensor induced by a bulk Dirac spinor in the Randall-Sundrum model	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.084036	Motivated by the possible extension into a supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, we investigate the properties of the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the stress-energy tensor for a quantized bulk Dirac spinor field in the RS geometry and compare it with that for a real scalar field. This is carried out via the Green function method based on first principles without invoking the degeneracy factor, whose validity in a warp geometry is a priori unassured. In addition, we investigate the local behavior of the Casimir energy near the two branes. One salient feature we found is that the surface divergences near the two branes have opposite signs. We argue that this is a generic feature of the fermionic Casimir energy density due to its parity transformation in the fifth dimension. Furthermore, we investigate the self-consistency of the RS metric under the quantum correction due to the stress-energy tensor. It is shown that the VEV of the stress-energy tensor and the classical one become comparable near the visible brane if k similar or equal to M similar or equal to M-P1 (the requirement of no hierarchy problem), where k is the curvature of the RS warped geometry and M the five-dimensional Planck mass. In that case the self-consistency of the RS model that includes bulk fields is in doubt. If, however, k less than or similar to M, then an approximate self-consistency of the RS-type metric may still be satisfied.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in time varying vacuum model	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.083514	The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is an important implication for dark energy. In this paper, we have calculated the power spectrum of the ISW effect in the time varying vacuum cosmological model, where the model parameter beta = 4.407 is obtained by the observational constraint of the growth rate. It is found that the source of the ISW effect is not only affected by the different evolutions of the Hubble function H(a) and the dimensionless matter density Omega(m)(a), but also by the different growth function D(+)(a), all of which are changed due to the presence of a matter production term in the time varying vacuum model. However, the difference of the ISW effect in the Lambda(t)CDM model and the Lambda CDM model is lessened to a certain extent because of the integration from the time of last scattering to the present. It is implied that the observations of the galaxies with high redshift are required to distinguish the two models.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Flavour mixing in an expanding universe	10.1002/andp.201010423	Motivated by a microscopic model of string-inspired foam, in which foamy structures are provided by brany point-like defects (D-particles) in space-time, we discuss flavour mixing in curved space-time for spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles. This can be view as the low energy limit of flavour non-preserving interactions of stringy matter excitations with the defects, and non-trivial space-time background induced by quantum fluctuations of the D-particles. We show, at late epochs of the Universe, that both the fermionic and the bosonic vacuum condensate behaves as a fluid with negative pressure and positive energy; however the equation of state has w(fermion) > -1/3 and therefore the contribution of fermion-fluid flavour vacuum alone could not yield accelerating Universes. On the other hand, for the boson fluid the equation of state is, for late eras, close to w(boson) -> -1, and hence overall the D-foam universe appears accelerating at late eras.

On the energy conditions in non-compact Kaluza-Klein gravity	10.1002/andp.201010427	We investigate a few cosmological solutions in non-compact five-dimensional space-time which is both Ricci-flat and conformally flat. We then study the reduced solutions on the brane in detail by applying the four energy conditions, which categorize our model in some classes. These classes of solutions can describe the universe including accelerating expansion with either abnormal matter (when matter specifically violates the strong energy condition, it is called abnormal) or a phantom model of dark energy and a Stephani universe which is dominated by abnormal matter describing vacuum energy.

Dark energy from quantum fluctuations	10.1002/andp.201010435	We have derived the quantum vacuum pressure p(vac) as a primary entity, removing a trivial and a gauge terms from the cosmological constant-like part (the zeroth term) of the effective action for a matter field. The quantum vacuum energy density (rho) over bar (vac) appears a secondary entity, but both are of expected order. Moreover P(vac) and (rho) over bar vac are dynamical, and therefore they can be used in the Einstein equations. In particular, they could dynamically support the holographic dark energy model as well as the ``thermodynamic one. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK
Entropy in the Present and Early Universe: New Small Parameters and Dark Energy Problem	10.3390/e12040932	It is demonstrated that entropy and its density play a significant role in solving the problem of the vacuum energy density (cosmological constant) of the Universe and hence the dark energy problem. Taking this in mind, two most popular models for dark energy-Holographic Dark Energy Model and Agegraphic Dark Energy Model-are analysed. It is shown that the fundamental quantities in the first of these models may be expressed in terms of a new small dimensionless parameter that is naturally occurring in High Energy Gravitational Thermodynamics and Gravitational Holography (UV-limit). On this basis, the possibility of a new approach to the problem of Quantum Gravity is discussed. Besides, the results obtained on the uncertainty relation of the pair ``cosmological constant-volume of space-time{''	ENTROPY
Fomin's Conception of Quantum Cosmogenesis	10.1134/S0202289310020052	The main aim of this paper is to extend the early approach to quantum cosmogenesis provided by Fomin. His approach was developed independently of the well-known Tryon description of creation of a closed universe as a process of quantum vacuum fluctuation. We apply Fomin's concept to derive the cosmological observables. We argue that Fomin's idea from his work of 1973, in contrast to Tryon's one, has an impact on the current Universe models, and the proposed extension of his theory can now be tested by distant SNIa supernovae. Fomin's idea of Universe creation is based on an intersection of two fundamental theories: general relativity and quantum field theory with the contemporary cosmological models with dark energy. As a result of comparison with contemporary approaches concerning dark energy, we have found out that Fomin's idea appears in the context of explaining the present acceleration of the Universe: cosmological models with decaying vacuum. Contemporary it appears in the form of a Ricci-scalar dark energy connected with the holographic principle. We also show that Fomin's model admits a bounce instead of an initial singularity. We demonstrate that Fomin's model of cosmogenesis can be simulated, and using the SNIa data, the values of model parameters are in agreement with observations.	GRAVITATION AND COSMOLOGY

The electromagnetic dark sector	10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.038	We consider electromagnetic field quantization in an expanding universe We find that the covariant (Gupta-Bleuler) method exhibits certain difficulties when trying to impose the quantum Lorenz condition on cosmological scales. We thus explore the possibility of consistently quantizing without imposing such a condition In this case there are three physical stares, which are the two transverse polarizations of the massless photon and a new massless scalar mode coming from the temporal and longitudinal components of the electromagnetic field An explicit example in de Sitter space-time shows that it is still possible to eliminate the negative norm state and to ensure the positivity of the energy in this theory The new state is decoupled from the conserved electromagnetic currents. but is non-conformally coupled to gravity and therefore can be excited from vacuum fluctuations by the expanding background The cosmological evolution ensures that the new state modifies Maxwell's equations in a totally negligible way on sub-Hubble scales. However, on cosmological scales it can give rise to a non-negligible energy density which could explain in a natural way the present phase of accelerated expansion of the universe (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Nonsingular and accelerated expanding universe from effective Yang-Mills theory	10.1088/0264-9381/27/6/065007	The energy-momentum tensor coming from one-parameter effective Yang-Mills theory is here used to describe the matter-energy content of the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann cosmology in its early stages. The behavior of all solutions is examined. Particularly, it is shown that only solutions corresponding to an open model allow the universe to evolve into an accelerated expansion. This result appears as a possible mechanism for an inflationary phase produced by a vector field. Further, depending on the value of some parameters characterizing the system, the resulting models are classified as singular or nonsingular.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Quantum vacuum effects as generalized f(R) gravity: Application to stars	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.064030	It is assumed that, for weak space-time curvature, the main gravitational effect of the quantum vacuum stress energy corresponds to adding two terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action, proportional to the square of the curvature scalar and to the contraction of two Ricci tensors, respectively. It is shown that compatibility with terrestrial and Solar System observations implies that the square roots of the coefficients of these terms should be either a few millimeters or a few hundred meters. It is shown that the vacuum contribution increase the stability of massive white dwarfs.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Perturbations in the relaxation mechanism for a large cosmological constant	10.1088/0264-9381/27/5/055001	Recently, a mechanism for relaxing a large cosmological constant (CC) has been proposed by Bauer et al (2009 Phys. Lett. B 678 427), which permits solutions with low Hubble rates at late times without fine-tuning. The setup is implemented in the Lambda XCDM framework, and we found a reasonable cosmological background evolution similar to the Lambda CDM model with a fine-tuned CC. In this work, we analyse analytically the perturbations in this relaxation model, and we show that their evolution is also similar to the Lambda CDM model, especially in the matter era. Some tracking properties of the vacuum energy are discussed, too.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
The random-motion theorem in a local cosmology with dark energy	10.1134/S1063772910030017	It is shown that the random-motion theorem in cosmology proven in the early 1960s can be generalized to take into account the presence of a uniform dark-energy background. The role of the dark energy is substantial: its repulsive force exceeds the gravitational force due to darkmatter and baryons, both on the scale of the Universe as a whole and on local scales of about 1 Mpc. The generalized random-motion theorem has the form of a differential equation relating the kinetic energy of the random motion and the potential energy of the particles due to their own gravitational field and the repulsive dark-energy field. One consequence of the generalized theorem is a virial relation containing the potential energy in the repulsive field.	ASTRONOMY REPORTS

Brans-Dicke cosmology in 4D from scalar-vacuum in 5D	10.1088/1475-7516/2010/03/030	We show that Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in 5D may explain the present cosmic accelerated expansion without recurring to matter fields in 5D or dark energy in 4D. Without making any assumption on the nature of the extra coordinate or the matter content in 5D, here we demonstrate that the vacuum BD field equations in 5D are equivalent, on every hypersurface orthogonal to the extra dimension, to a BD theory in 4D with a self interacting potential and an effective matter field. The potential is not introduced by hand, instead the reduction procedure provides an expression that determines its shape up to a constant of integration. It also establishes the explicit formulae for the effective matter in 4D. In the context of FRW cosmologies, we show that the reduced BD theory gives rise to models for accelerated expansion of a matter-dominated universe which are consistent with current observations and with a decelerating radiation-dominated epoch.

Spherical systems in models of nonlocally corrected gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.044032	The properties of static, spherically symmetric configurations are considered in the framework of two models of nonlocally corrected gravity, suggested in S. Deser and R. Woodard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 111301 (2007) and S. Capozziello et al., Phys. Lett. B 671, 193 (2009). For the first case, where the Lagrangian of nonlocal origin represents a scalar-tensor theory with two massless scalars, an explicit condition is found under which both scalar fields are canonical (nonphantom). If this condition does not hold, one of the fields exhibits a phantom behavior. Scalar-vacuum configurations then behave in a manner known for scalar-tensor theories. In the second case, the Lagrangian of nonlocal origin exhibits a scalar field interacting with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant and contains an arbitrary scalar field potential. It is found that the GB term, in general, leads to violation of the well-known no-go theorems valid for minimally coupled scalar fields in general relativity. It is shown, however, that some configurations of interest are still forbidden-whatever be the scalar field potential and the GB-scalar coupling function, namely, ``force-free{''} wormholes (such that g(tt) = const) and black holes with higher-order horizons.

Gluon condensate, modified gravity, and the accelerating Universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.043006	It has been suggested recently to study the dynamics of a gravitating gluon condensate q in the context of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. The expansion of the Universe (or, more generally, the presence of a nonvanishing Ricci curvature scalar R) perturbs the gluon condensate and may induce a nonanalytic term (h) over tilde (R, q) in the effective gravitational action. The aim of this article is to explore the cosmological implications of a particular nonanalytic term (h) over tilde proportional to eta vertical bar R vertical bar(1/2)vertical bar q vertical bar(3/4). With a quadratic approximation of the gravitating gluon-condensate vacuum energy density rho(V)(q) near the equilibrium value q(0) and a small coupling constant eta of the modified-gravity term (h) over tilde, an ``accelerating universe{''} is obtained which resembles the present Universe, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The unknown component X of this model universe (here, primarily due to modified-gravity effects) has an effective equation-of-state parameter (w) over bar (X) which is found to evolve toward the value -1 from above.

Modified gravity in Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.12.063	Motivated by Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory, we propose and investigate two kinds of modified gravity theories, the f(R) kind and the K-essence kind, in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism. The f (R) kind includes one ultraviolet (UV) term and one infrared (IR) term together with the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find that these two terms naturally present the ultraviolet and infrared modifications to the Friedmann equation. The UV and IR modifications can avoid the past Big-Bang singularity and the future Big-Rip Singularity, respectively. Furthermore, the IR modification can naturally account for the current acceleration of the Universe. The Lagrangian of K-essence kind modified gravity is made up of the three-dimensional Ricci scalar and an arbitrary function of the extrinsic curvature term. We find the cosmic acceleration can also be naturally interpreted without invoking any kind of dark energy. The static, spherically symmetry and vacuum solutions of both theories are Schwarzschild or Schwarzschildde Sitter solution. Thus these modified gravity theories are viable for solar system tests.

A Discrete Nonetheless Remarkable Brick in de Sitter: the ``Massless Minimally Coupled Field{''}	10.1134/S1063778810020031	Over the last ten years interest in the physics of de Sitter space-time has been growing very fast. Besides the supposed existence of a ``de Sitterian period{''} in inflation theories, the observational evidence of an acceleration of the universe expansion (interpreted as a positive cosmological constant or a ``dark energy{''} or some form of ``quintessence{''}) has triggered a lot of attention in the physics community. A specific de Sitterian field called ``massless minimally coupled field{''} (mmc) plays a fundamental role in inflation models and in the construction of the de Sitterian gravitational field. A covariant quantization of the mmc field, a la Krein-Gupta-Bleuler was proposed in Class. Quantum. Grav. 17, 1415 (2000). In this talk, we will review this construction and explain the relevance of such a field in the construction of a massless spin-2 field in de Sitter space-time.	PHYSICS OF ATOMIC NUCLEI
Space-time curvature due to quantum vacuum fluctuations: An alternative to dark energy?	10.1016/j.physleta.2009.11.079	It is pointed Out that quantum vacuum fluctuations may give rise to a curvature of space-time equivalent to the Curvature currently attributed to dark energy. A simple calculation is made, involving plausible assumptions within the framework of quantized gravity, which Suggests that the value of the dark energy density is roughly given by the product Of Newton's constant times the quantity m(6)C(4)h(-4), m being a typical mass of elementary particles. The estimate is compatible with observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS A
Completely regular quantum stress tensor with w < -1	10.1103/PhysRevD.81.023508	For many quantum field theory computations in cosmology it is not possible to use the flat space trick of obtaining full, interacting states by evolving free states over infinite times. State wave functionals must be specified at finite times and, although the free states suffice to obtain the lowest order effects, higher order corrections necessarily involve changes of the initial state. Failing to correctly change the initial state can result in effective field equations which diverge on the initial value surface, or which contain tedious sums of terms that redshift like inverse powers of the scale factor. In this paper we verify a conjecture from 2004 that the lowest order initial state correction can indeed absorb the initial value divergences and all the redshifting terms of the two-loop expectation value (in free, Bunch-Davies vacuum) of the stress tensor of a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on a nondynamical de Sitter background.

The cosmological constant and the relaxed universe	10.1088/1742-6596/259/1/012083	We study the role of the cosmological constant (CC) as a component of dark energy (DE). It is argued that the cosmological term is in general unavoidable and it should not be ignored even when dynamical DE sources are considered. From the theoretical point of view quantum zero-point energy and phase transitions suggest a CC of large magnitude in contrast to its tiny observed value. Simply relieving this disaccord with a counterterm requires extreme fine-tuning which is referred to as the old CC problem. To avoid it, we discuss some recent approaches for neutralising a large CC dynamically without adding a fine-tuned counterterm. This can be realised by an effective DE component which relaxes the cosmic expansion by counteracting the effect of the large CC. Alternatively, a CC filter is constructed by modifying gravity to make it insensitive to vacuum energy.	"16TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PARTICLES, STRINGS AND COSMOLOGY (PASCOS

Dark Energy density in Split SUSY models inspired by degenerate vacua		It is well known that global symmetries protect local supersymmetry and a zero value for the cos-mological constant in no-scale supergravity. The breakdown of these symmetries, which ensure the vanishing of the vacuum energy density, results in a set of degenerate vacua with broken and unbroken supersymmetry leading to the natural realisation of the multiple point principle (MPP). Assuming the degeneracy of vacua with broken and unbroken SUSY in the hidden sector we estimate the value of the cosmological constant. We argue that the observed value of the dark energy density can be reproduced in the split-SUSY scenario if the SUSY breaking scale is of the order of 10(10)GeV.	35TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS (ICHEP 2010)

Development of a cryogenic system for the VIRUS array of 150 spectrographs for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope	10.1117/12.857362	The upcoming Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) has provided motivation for upgrading the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at the McDonald Observatory. This upgrade includes an increase in the field-of-view to accommodate the new and revolutionary Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS). VIRUS is the instrument designed to conduct the HETDEX survey and consists of 150 individual integral-field spectrographs fed by 33,600 total optical fibers covering the 22 arc-minute field-of-view of the upgraded HET. The spectrographs are mounted in four enclosures, each 6.0x3.0x1.4 meters in size. Each spectrograph contains a CCD detector that must be cryogenically cooled, presenting an interesting cryogenic and vacuum challenge within the distribution system. In this paper, we review the proposed vacuum jacketed, thermal siphon, liquid nitrogen distribution system used to cool the array of detectors and discuss recent developments. We focus on the design, prototyping, and testing of a novel ``make-break{''} thermal connector, built from a modified cryogenic bayonet, that is used to quickly detach a single spectrograph pair from the system.

Mechanical design evolution of the VIRUS instrument for volume production and deployment	10.1117/12.857314	The Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) is an integral field spectrograph to support observations for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). The VIRUS instrument is fed by more than 33,000 optical fibers and consists of 150 spectrographs in 75 individual, identical units. This paper discusses the evolution in mechanical design of the VIRUS unit spectrographs to maximize the cost benefit from volume production. Design features which enable volume manufacture and assembly are discussed. Strategies for reducing part count while enabling precision alignment are detailed. Design considerations for deployment, operation, and maintenance en mass at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope are also made. In addition, several enabling technologies are described including the use of cast aluminum in vacuum housings, use of cast Invar, and processing cast parts for precision tolerances.

The event horizon thermodynamical (ehT-) model of the dark energy	10.1063/1.3462707	We present the main results of a model, namely the event-horizon model, based on a thermodynamical approach for the law of Lambda(t). We consider a phenomenological model where we give to the effective cosmological `constant' Lambda the physical meaning of a `vacuum' energy density, as usually admitted. In the same vein as the generalization of the black holes [1][2] and of the de Sitter event-horizon thermodynamics [3][4] to the FLRW space-time, we associated to this `vacuum' energy density a full thermodynamics for cosmological event horizons without further microscopic precision about the fields describing the vacuum. Without any ansatz and using thermodynamics arguments, we then deduce the law Lambda proportional to r(-2) where r is the proper radius of the event horizon in quasi-de Sitter FLRW spatially flat spacetime. With this relation, the coincidence problem is solved by the decay of Lambda(t) due to the expansion of the universe. We apply this model to the study of the recent accelerated expansion phase and to the coincidence problem. Finally, we introduce a logarithmic corrective term in the entropy associated to the DE, which leads to a new term in the DE density. This term was derived for any thermodynamical system encountering fluctuations around an equilibrium state [16]. This corrective term was first applied to black hole. Because of the analogy between the cosmological FLRW event horizon and the Black hole event horizon, it seems legitimate to introduce this corrective term in the entropy of Lambda. After a numerical resolution, we compute the evolutions of the main cosmological parameters: Lambda(t), the Hubble parameter H(t), the vacuum density Omega(Lambda)(t). The computed values are compatible with an initial inflation, and the current observations of the `concordance' model. It also predicts a graceful exit of early inflation and the present acceleration and solves in the same time the age and the coincidence problem.	INVISIBLE UNIVERSE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

Although significant constraints will emerge, a wide range of models and values of parameters will still be left open. Cosmological implications of allowed LSV patterns are discussed focusing on the origin of our Universe, the cosmological constant, dark matter and dark energy. Superbradyons (superluminal preons) may be the actual constituents of vacuum and of standard particles, and form equally a cosmological sea leading to new forms of dark matter and dark energy.

Assembly of the Dark Energy Survey CCD Imager	10.1117/12.857480	The Dark Energy Camera (DECam) is the new wide field prime-focus imager for the Blanco 4m telescope at CTIO. This instrument is a 2.2 sq. deg. camera with a 45 cm diameter focal plane consisting of 62 2k x 4k CCDs and 12 2k x 2k CCDs and was developed for the Dark Energy Survey that will start operations at CTIO in 2011. DECam includes the vessel shell, the optical window cell, the CCDs with their readout electronics and vacuum interface, the focal plane support plate and its mounts, and the cooling system and thermal controls. Assembly of the imager, alignment of the focal plane and installation of the CCDs are described. During DECam development a full scale prototype was used for multi-CCD readout tests. This test vessel went through several stages as the CCDs and related hardware progressed from early prototypes to final production designs.

2nd Big Challenge Symposium: The Big Challenge of Cosmological Understanding: Gravitation, Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Towards New Scenarios		This Symposium is devoted to the Memory of Lev Kofman, June-17-1957-November-12-2009. The accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is today observed, shows that cosmological dynamics is dominated by the so-called Dark Energy field which provides a large negative pressure. This is the standard picture, in which such new ingredient is considered as a source of the right hand side of the field equations. It should be some form of non-clustered non-zero vacuum energy which, together with the clustered Dark Matter, drives the global dynamics. This is the so-called ``concordance model{''} (ACDM) which gives, in agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), dim Lyman Limit Systems (ILLS) and type la supernovae (SNeIa) data, a good framework to understand the today observed Universe. However, it presents several shortcomings as the well known ``coincidence{''} and ``cosmological constant{''} problems. An alternative approach is to have a better understanding of the energy concept in General Relativity and also to change the left hand side of the field equations, and check if observed cosmic dynamics can be achieved by extending general relativity. In this different context, it is not required to search candidates for Dark Energy and Dark Matter, which till now have not been found. Rather, one can only stand on the ``observed{''} ingredients: curvature and baryon matter, to account for the observations. Considering this point of view, one can think of that gravity is not scale-invariant. The goal of this Symposium is to obtain a tapestry of the present status of theory and observations concerning Gravitation and Dark Universe.	NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS, VOLS I-III
The Chameleon Solid Rocket Propulsion Model	10.1063/1.3326248	The Khoury and Weltman (2004a and 2004b) Chameleon Model presents an addition to the gravitation force and was shown by the author (Robertson, 2009a and 2009b) to present a new means by which one can view other forces in the Universe. The Chameleon Model is basically a density-dependent model and while the idea is not new, this model is novel in that densities in the Universe to include the vacuum of space are viewed as scalar fields. Such an analogy gives the Chameleon scalar field, dark energy/dark matter like characteristics; fitting well within cosmological expansion theories. In respect to this forum, in this paper, it is shown how the Chameleon Model can be used to derive the thrust of a solid rocket motor. This presents a first step toward the development of new propulsion models using density variations verse mass ejection as the mechanism for thrust. Further, through the Chameleon Model connection, these new propulsion models can be tied to dark energy/dark matter toward new space propulsion systems utilizing the vacuum scalar field in a way understandable by engineers, the key toward the development of such systems. This paper provides corrections to the Chameleon rocket model in Robertson (2009b).	SPACE, PROPULSION \& ENERGY SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL FORUM SPESIF- 2010
Entropy in the Present and Early Universe and Vacuum Energy	10.1063/1.3382324	It is demonstrated that entropy and its density play a significant role in solving the problem of the vacuum energy density (cosmological constant) in the Universe and hence the dark energy problem. Taking this in mind, two most popular models for dark energy - Holographic Dark Energy Model and Agegraphic Dark Energy Model - are analyzed. It is shown that the fundamental quantities in the first of these models may be expressed in terms of a new small parameter. Besides, the results obtained on the uncertainty relation of the pair ``cosmological constant - volume of space-time{''	SUN, THE STARS, THE UNIVERSE, AND GENERAL RELATIVITY
Quantum vacuum energy in graphs and billiards		The vacuum (Casimir) energy in quantum field theory is a problem relevant both to new nanotechnology devices and to dark energy in cosmology. The crucial question is the dependence of the energy on the system geometry. Despite much progress since the first prediction of the Casimir effect in 1948 and its subsequent experimental verification in simple geometries, even the sign of the force in nontrivial situations is still a matter of controversy. Mathematically, vacuum energy fits squarely into the spectral theory of second-order self-adjoint elliptic linear differential operators. Specifically one promising approach is based on the small-t asymptotics of the cylinder kernel e(-t root H) , where H is the self-adjoint operator under study. In contrast with the well-studied heat kernel e(-tH), the cylinder kernel depends in a non-local way on the geometry of the problem. We discuss some results by the Louisiana-Oklahoma-Texas collaboration on vacuum energy in model systems, including quantum graphs and two-dimensional cavities. The results may shed light on general questions, including the relationship between vacuum energy and periodic or closed classical orbits, and the contribution to vacuum energy of boundaries, edges, and corners.

Constraining super-critical string/brane cosmologies with astrophysical data	10.1088/1742-6596/203/1/012054	We discuss fits of unconventional dark energy models to the available data from high-redshift supernovae, distant galaxies and baryon oscillations. The models are based either on brane cosmologies or on Liouville strings in which a relaxation dark energy is provided by a rolling dilaton field (Q-cosmology). Such cosmologies feature the possibility of effective four-dimensional negative-energy dust and/or exotic scaling of dark matter. We find evidence for a negative-energy dust at the current era, as well as for exotic-scaling (a(-delta)) contributions to the energy density, with delta similar or equal to 4, which could be due to dark matter coupling with the dilaton in Q-cosmology models. We conclude that Q-cosmology fits the data equally well with the ACDM model for a range of parameters that are in general expected from theoretical considerations.

ON VACUUM DENSITY, THE INITIAL SINGULARITY AND DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0218271809016120	Standard cosmology poses a number of important questions. Apart from its singular origin, it possesses early and late accelerating phases required to account for observations. The vacuum energy has been considered as a possible way to resolve some of these questions. The vacuum energy density induced by free fields in an early de Sitter phase has earlier been estimated to be proportional to H(4), while more recently it has been suggested that the QCD condensate induces a term proportional to H at late times. These results have been employed in models which are nonsingular and inflationary at early times and accelerating at late times. Here we cast these models in terms of scalar fields and study the corresponding spectrum of primordial perturbations. At early times the spectrum is found to be not scale-invariant, thus implying that slow roll inflation is still required after the phase transition induced by the vacuum. At late times the corresponding scalar field potential is harmonic, with a mass of the order of the Hubble scale - a result that may be understood in the light of the holographic conjecture.

Solving the main cosmological puzzles with a generalized time varying vacuum energy	10.1051/0004-6361/200912575	We study the dynamics of the FLRW flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy density varies with time, Lambda(t). In particular, we investigate the dynamical properties of a generalized vacuum model, and we find that under certain circumstances the vacuum term in the radiation era varies as Lambda(z) infinity (1 + z)(4), while in the matter era we have Lambda(z) infinity (1 + z)(3) up to z similar or equal to 3 and Lambda(z) similar or equal to Lambda for z <= 3. The confirmation of such a behavior would be of paramount importance because it could provide a solution to the cosmic coincidence problem as well as to the fine-tuning problem, without changing the well known (from the concordance Lambda-cosmology) Hubble expansion.

Local dark matter and dark energy as estimated on a scale of similar to 1 Mpc in a self-consistent way	10.1051/0004-6361/200912762	Context. Dark energy was first detected from large distances on gigaparsec scales. If it is vacuum energy (or Einstein's.), it should also exist in very local space. Here we discuss its measurement on megaparsec scales of the Local Group. Aims. We combine the modified Kahn-Woltjer method for the Milky Way-M 31 binary and the HST observations of the expansion flow around the Local Group in order to study in a self-consistent way and simultaneously the local density of dark energy and the dark matter mass contained within the Local Group. Methods. A theoretical model is used that accounts for the dynamical effects of dark energy on a scale of similar to 1 Mpc. Results. The local dark energy density is put into the range 0.8-3.7 rho(v) (rho(v) is the globally measured density), and the Local Group mass lies within 3.1-5.8 x 10(12) M(circle dot). The lower limit of the local dark energy density, about 4/5x the global value, is determined by the natural binding condition for the group binary and the maximal zero-gravity radius. The near coincidence of two values measured with independent methods on scales differing by similar to 1000 times is remarkable. The mass similar to 4 x 10(12) M(circle dot) and the local dark energy density similar to rho(v) are also consistent with the expansion flow close to the Local Group, within the standard cosmological model. Conclusions. One should take into account the dark energy in dynamical mass estimation methods for galaxy groups, including the virial theorem. Our analysis gives new strong evidence in favor of Einstein's idea of the universal antigravity described by the cosmological constant.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Vacuum Energy as the Origin of the Gravitational Constant	10.1007/s10701-009-9364-z	We develop a geometro-dynamical approach to the cosmological constant problem (CCP) by invoking a geometry induced by the energy-momentum tensor of vacuum, matter and radiation. The construction, which utilizes the dual role of the metric tensor that it structures both the spacetime manifold and energy-momentum tensor of the vacuum, gives rise to a framework in which the vacuum energy induced by matter and radiation, instead of gravitating, facilitates the generation of the gravitational constant. The non-vacuum sources comprising matter and radiation gravitate normally. At the level of classical gravitation, the mechanism deadens the CCP yet quantum gravitational effects, if strong, can keep it existent.	FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
On the possible running of the cosmological ``constant{''}	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.10.073	Despite the many outstanding cosmological observations leading to a strong evidence for a non-vanishing cosmological constant (CC) term A in the gravitational field equations, the theoretical Status of this quantity seems to be lagging well behind the observational successes. It thus seems timely to revisit some fundamental aspects of the CC term in Quantum Field Theory (QFT). We emphasize that, in curved space-time, nothing a priori prevents this term from potentially having a mild running behavior associated to quantum effects. Remarkably, this could be the very origin of the dynamical nature of the Dark Energy, in contrast to many other popular options considered in the literature. In discussing this possibility. we also address some recent criticisms concerning the possibility of such running. Our conclusion is that, while there is no comprehensive proof of the CC running, there is no proof of the non-running either. The problem can be solved only through a deeper understanding of the vacuum contributions of massive quantum fields oil a curved space-time background. We suggest that such investigations are at the heart of one of the most important endeavors of fundamental theoretical cosmology in the years to come. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ANALYTICAL CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT AND DARK ENERGY	10.1142/S0217751X09046254	The accelerated expansion of the universe has now been confirmed by several independent observations including those of high redshift type Ia supernovae, and the cosmic microwave background combined with the large scale structure of the universe. Another way of presenting this kinematic property of the universe is to postulate the existence of a new and exotic entity, with negative pressure, the dark energy (DE). In spite of observationally well established, no single theoretical model provides an entirely compelling framework within which cosmic acceleration or DE can be understood. At present all existing observational data are in agreement with the simplest possibility that the cosmological constant be a candidate for DE. This case is internally self-consistent and noncontradictory. The extreme smallness of the cosmological constant expressed in either Planck, or even atomic units means only that its origin is not related to strong, electromagnetic, and weak interactions. Although in this case DE reduces to only a single fundamental constant we still have no derivation from any underlying quantum field theory for its small value. From the principles of quantum cosmologies, for example, it is possible to obtain the reason for an inverse-square law for the cosmological constant with no conflict with observations. Despite the fact that this general expression is well known, in this work we introduce families of analytical solutions for the scale factor different from the current literature. The knowledge of the scale factor behavior might shed some light on these questions mentioned above since the entire evolution of a homogeneous isotropic universe is contained in the scale factor. We use different parameters for these solutions and with these parameters we establish a connection with the equation of state for different DE scenarios.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
TRAPPING OF NONLINEAR GRAVITATIONAL WAVES BY TWO-FLUID SYSTEMS	10.1142/S0217732309032083	We show that the coupled two-fluid gravitating system (e.g. stiff matter and ``vacuum energy{''}) could trap nonlinear gravitational waves (e.g. Einstein-Rosen waves). The gravitational wave amplitude varies harmonically in time transferring the energy coherently to the stiff matter wave, and then the process goes to the backward direction. This process mimics the behavior of trapped electromagnetic waves in two-level media. We have defined the limits for the frequency of this energy transfer oscillations.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A

This solution corresponds to a constant Ricci scalar. We proved that in f(R) gravity the constant curvature solution in cylindrically symmetric cases is only one member of the most generalized Tian family in GR. We show that our constant curvature exact solution is applicable to the exterior of a string. The sensibility of stability under initial conditions is discussed.

The ``writing on the cosmic wall{''}: Is there a straightforward explanation of the cosmic microwave background?	10.1002/andp.200910365	The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is taken today as reflecting the thermodynamical state of the universe at these early cosmic times. Based on this assumption and standard cosmological principles meanwhile many fundamental cosmological facts have been deduced from the CMB state which, however, to some surprise reveal that the universe should be dominated by dark energy and dark matter, while for its energy content the usual baryonic matter is nearly negligible. Thus the question which we want to raise in this article is, whether this standard interpretation of the CMB phenomenon is solid and unequivocal enough to support the standard cosmological claims. We shall show, however, that in many details the standard explanation is not straightforward, but allows for important alternatives which seriously should be looked at. Especially arguments for a vanishing cosmic curvature (k = 0) are shown to be weak, and, contrary to the usual claim, the light distance to the recombination horizon is in fact strongly model-biassed. We also show that the CMB dipole which is generally understood as a consequence of a peculiar motion by about 680 km/s with respect to rest system of the CMB can as well, and perhaps even better, be understood as indication of differerent cosmological expansion dynamics seen in an anisotropically expanding universe in different directions of the sky. We also discuss that the power amplitude (i.e. effective Planck temperature) in the dipolar CMB structure depends on wavelength even inverting the dipole maximum orientation in the Wien's branch. In addition unexpected properties of the lowest CMB multipoles could mean that we are at least partly seeing an unquantifyable foreground in the background. Only after its removal the CMB interpretation could at all then, hut then on a completely new basis, become a subject of cosmological terms. At the end of this article we shall briefly discuss an alternative explanation of the CMB radiation which helps to better understand the mysterious cosmic photon-to-baryon ratio of about 10(9).

On the Casimir energy for a massive quantum scalar field and the cosmological constant	10.1016/j.aop.2009.07.001	We present a rigorous, regularization-independent local quantum field theoretic treatment of the Casimir effect for a quantum scalar field of mass mu not equal 0 which yields closed form expressions for the energy density and pressure. As an application we show that there exist special states of the quantum field in which the expectation value of the renormalized energy-momentum tensor is, for any fixed time, independent of the space coordinate and of the perfect fluid form g(mu,nu)rho with rho > 0, thus providing a concrete quantum field theoretic model of the cosmological constant. This rho represents the energy density associated to a state consisting of the vacuum and a certain number of excitations of zero momentum, i.e., the constituents correspond to lowest energy and pressure p <= 0.

On vacuum density, the initial singularity and dark energy	10.1007/s10714-009-0846-2	Standard cosmology poses a number of important questions. Apart from its singular origin, it possesses early and late accelerating phases required to account for observations. The vacuum energy has been considered as a possible way to resolve some of these questions. The vacuum energy density induced by free fields in an early de Sitter phase has earlier been estimated to be proportional to H (4), while more recently it has been suggested that the QCD condensate induces a term proportional to H at late times. These results have been employed in models which are non-singular and inflationary at early times and accelerating at late times. Here we cast these models in terms of scalar fields and study the corresponding spectrum of primordial perturbations. At early times the spectrum is found to be not scale-invariant, thus implying that slow-roll inflation is still required after the phase transition induced by the vacuum. At late times the corresponding scalar-field potential is harmonic, with a mass of the order of the Hubble scale, a result that may be understood in the light of the holographic conjecture.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Hubble expansion and structure formation in time varying vacuum models	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.083511	We investigate the properties of the FLRW flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy density evolves with time, Lambda(t). Using different versions of the Lambda(t) model, namely, quantum field vacuum, power series vacuum and power law vacuum, we find that the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the Universe, the Hubble expansion rate H, and the energy densities are defined analytically. Performing a joint likelihood analysis of the recent supernovae type Ia data, the cosmic microwave background shift parameter and the baryonic acoustic oscillations traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, we put tight constraints on the main cosmological parameters of the Lambda(t) scenarios. Furthermore, we study the linear matter fluctuation field of the above vacuum models. We find that the patterns of the power series vacuum Lambda = n(1)H + n(2)H(2) predict stronger small scale dynamics, which implies a faster growth rate of perturbations with respect to the other two vacuum cases ( quantum field and power law), despite the fact that all the cosmological models share the same equation of state parameter. In the case of the quantum field vacuum Lambda = n(0) + n(2)H(2), the corresponding matter fluctuation field resembles that of the traditional Lambda cosmology. The power law vacuum (Lambda proportional to a(-n)) mimics the classical quintessence cosmology, the best fit being tilted in the phantom phase. In this framework, we compare the observed growth rate of clustering measured from the optical galaxies with those predicted by the current Lambda(t) models. Performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test we show that the cosmological models which contain a constant vacuum (Lambda CDM), quantum field vacuum, and power law vacuum provide growth rates that match well with the observed growth rate. However, this is not the case for the power series vacuum models ( in particular, the frequently adduced Lambda proportional to H model) in which clusters form at significantly earlier times (z >= 4) with respect to all other models (z similar to 2). Finally, we derived the theoretically predicted dark matter halo mass function and the corresponding distribution of cluster-size halos for all the models studied. Their expected redshift distribution indicates that it will be difficult to distinguish the closely resembling models ( constant vacuum, quantum field, and power law vacuum), using realistic future x-ray surveys of cluster abundances. However, cluster surveys based on the Sunayev-Zeldovich detection method give some hope to distinguish the closely resembling models at high redshifts.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Neutrino dark energy in grand unified theories	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.073013	We studied a left-right symmetric model that can accommodate the neutrino dark energy (nu DE) proposal. The type-III seesaw mechanism is implemented to give masses to the neutrinos. After explaining the model, we study the consistency of the model by minimizing the scalar potential and obtaining the conditions for the required vacuum expectation values of the different scalar fields. This model is then embedded in an SO(10) grand unified theory and the allowed symmetry breaking scales are determined by the condition of the gauge coupling unification. Although SU(2)(R) breaking is required to be high, its Abelian subgroup U(1)(R) is broken in the TeV range, which can then give the required neutrino masses and predicts new gauge bosons that could be detected at LHC. The neutrino masses are studied in detail in this model, which shows that at least 3 singlet fermions are required.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Flavor condensates in brane models and dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.084046	In the context of a microscopic model of string-inspired foam, in which foamy structures are provided by brany pointlike defects (D-particles) in space-time, we discuss flavor mixing as a result of flavor nonpreserving interactions of (low-energy) fermionic stringy matter excitations with the defects. Such interactions involve splitting and capture of the matter string state by the defect, and subsequent reemission. As a result of charge conservation, only electrically neutral matter can interact with the D-particles. Quantum fluctuations of the D-particles induce a nontrivial space-time background; in some circumstances, this could be akin to a cosmological Friedman-Robertson-Walker expanding-universe, with weak (but nonzero) particle production. Furthermore, the D-particle medium can induce an Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein-type effect. We have argued previously, in the context of bosons, that the so-called flavor vacuum is the appropriate state to be used, at least for low-energy excitations, with energies/momenta up to a dynamically determined cutoff scale. Given the intriguing mass scale provided by neutrino flavor mass differences from the point of view of dark energy, we evaluate the flavor-vacuum expectation value (condensate) of the stress-energy tensor of the 1/2-spin fields with mixing in an effective-low-energy quantum field theory in this foam-induced curved space-time. We demonstrate, at late epochs of the Universe, that the fermionic vacuum condensate behaves as a fluid with negative pressure and positive energy; however, the equation of state has w(fermion) > -1/3 and so the contribution of the fermion-fluid flavor vacuum alone could not yield accelerating universes. Such contributions to the vacuum energy should be considered as (algebraically) additive to the flavored boson contributions, evaluated in our previous works; this should be considered as natural from (broken) target-space supersymmetry that characterizes realistic superstring/supermembrane models of space-time foam. The boson fluid is also characterized by positive energy and negative pressure, but its equation of state is, for late eras, close to w(boson) -> -1, and hence overall the D-foam universe appears accelerating at late eras.

The variable cosmological constant and dynamics of dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.08.064	We study the variable cosmological constant model with the interaction between dark energy and matter. By constructing the dark energy component as an effective quintessence scalar field, we give an upper limit of parameter in with weak gravity conjecture which requires that the variation of the scalar field Delta phi should be less than the Planck mass M-p. On the other hand, we constrain the model parameters with recent type Ia supernovae and WMAP five-year observation, which gives a consistent result with weak gravity conjecture. The combination of these observational data restricts the model parameters within narrow ranges with Omega(m0) = 0.276(-0.017)(+0.020) 0 <= m <= 0.075, showing that weak interaction between dark energy and matter is favored in this model. The involving behaviors of relative densities Omega(m)(z). Omega(de)(z) and decelerated parameter q(z) are also Studied with the constrained parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The evolution of our local cosmic domain: effective causal limits	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15209.x	The causal limit usually considered in cosmology is the particle horizon, delimiting the possibilities of causal connection in the expanding Universe. However, it is not a realistic indicator of the effective local limits of important interactions in space-time. We consider here the matter horizon for the Solar system, i.e. the comoving region which has significantly contributed matter to our local physical environment. This lies inside the effective domain of dependence, which ( assuming the universe is dominated by dark matter along with baryonic matter and vacuum-energy-like dark energy) consists of those regions that have had a significant active physical influence on this environment through effects such as matter accretion and acoustic waves. It is not determined by the velocity of light c, but by the flow of matter perturbations along their world lines and associated gravitational effects. We emphasize how small a region the perturbations which became our Galaxy occupied, relative to the observable universe even relative to the smallest scale perturbations detectable in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Finally, looking to the future of our local cosmic domain, we suggest simple dynamical criteria for determining the present domain of influence and the future matter horizon. The former is the radial distance at which our local region is just now separating from the cosmic expansion. The latter represents the limits of growth of the matter horizon in the far future.

Bianchi VI0\&III models: self-similar approach	10.1088/0264-9381/26/17/175003	We study several cosmological models with Bianchi VI0&III symmetries under the self-similar approach. We find new solutions for the `classical' perfect fluid model as well as for the vacuum model although they are really restrictive for the equation of state. We also study a perfect fluid model with time-varying constants, G and Lambda. As in other studied models we find that the behaviour of G and Lambda are related. If G behaves as a growing time function then Lambda is a positive decreasing time function but if G is decreasing then Lambda(0) is negative. We end by studying a massive cosmic string model, putting special emphasis in calculating the numerical values of the equations of state. We show that there is no SS solution for a string model with time-varying constants.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
EXPLORING TRANS-PLANCKIAN PHYSICS AND THE CURVATURE EFFECT BY THE PRIMORDIAL POWER SPECTRUM WITH WMAP FIVE-YEAR DATA	10.1142/S0218271809015126	The vacuum inflation with a boundary condition specified at a short distance scale in a generally primeval nonflat universe, and implications of the correspondingly modified primordial power spectrum via the WMAP data are investigated. We obtain a general form of the modified primordial power spectrum including the effects of both the possibly new physics scale and the spatial curvature. The modulation of the primordial power spectrum due to new physics is of the order H/Lambda, where H is the Hubble parameter during inflation and. is the new physics scale which is key to inflation, while the modulation from the curvature effect is of the order K/k(2), where K is the spatial curvature before inflation and k is the comoving wave number. We also find that a closed universe before inflation is favored by WMAP five-year data.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Cosmological constant, violation of cosmological isotropy and CMB	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/09/018	We suggest that the solution to the cosmological vacuum energy puzzle does not require any new field beyond the standard model, but rather can be explained as a result of the interaction of the infrared sector of the effective theory of gravity with standard model fields. The cosmological constant in this framework can be presented in terms of QCD parameters and the Hubble constant H as follows, epsilon(vac)similar or equal to H . mq((q) over barq)/m eta' similar or equal to(4.3 . 10(-3) eV)(4), which is amazingly close to the observed value today. In this work we explain how this proposal can be tested by analyzing CMB data. In particular, knowing the value of the observed cosmological constant fixes univocally the smallest size of the spatially flat, constant time 3d hypersurface which, for instance in the case of an effective 1-torus, is predicted to be around 74 Gpc. We also comment on another important prediction of this framework which is a violation of cosmological isotropy. Such anisotropy is indeed apparently observed by WMAP, and will be confirmed (or ruled out) by future PLANCK data.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Holographic dark energy model with Hubble horizon as an IR cut-off	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/09/016	The main task of this paper is to realize a cosmic observational compatible universe in the framework of holographic dark energy model when the Hubble horizon H is taken as the role of an IR cut-off. When the model parameter c of a time variable cosmological constant (CC) Lambda( t) = 3c(2)H(2) (t) becomes time or scale dependent, an extra term enters in the effective equation of sate ( EoS) of the vacuum energy w(Lambda)(eff) = -c(2) - d lnc(2) /3d ln a. This extra term can make the effective EoS of time variable CC cross the cosmological boundary and be phantom-like at present. For the lack of a first principle and fundamental physics theory to obtain the form c 2, we give a simple parameterized form of c 2 as an example. Then the model is confronted by the cosmic observations including SN Ia, BAO and CMB shift parameter R. The result shows that the model is consistent with cosmic observations.

Solar system constraints on f(G) gravity models	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.063516	We discuss solar system constraints on f(G) gravity models, where f is a function of the Gauss-Bonnet term G. We focus on cosmologically viable f(G) models that can be responsible for late-time cosmic acceleration. These models generally give rise to corrections of the form epsilon(r/r(s))(p) to the vacuum Schwarzschild solution, where epsilon = H({*})(2)r(s)(2) << 1, r(s) is the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun, and H-{*} is the Hubble parameter today. We generally estimate the strength of modifications to general relativity in order to confront models with a number of experiments, such as the deflection of light and the perihelion shift. We show that cosmologically viable f(G) models can be consistent with solar system constraints for a wide range of model parameters.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Stagflation: Bose-Einstein condensation in the early universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.063520	Our universe experienced the accelerated expansion at least twice; an extreme inflationary acceleration in the early universe and the recent mild acceleration. By introducing the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase of a boson field, we have been developing a unified model of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) for the later mild acceleration. In this scenario, two phases of BEC ( = DE) and normal gas ( = DM) transform with each other through BEC phase transition. This unified model has successfully explained the mild acceleration as an attractor. We extend this BEC cosmology to the early universe without introducing new ingredients. In this scenario, the inflation is naturally initiated by the condensation of the bosons in the huge vacuum energy. This inflation and even the cosmic expansion eventually terminates exactly at zero energy density. We call this stage as stagflation. At this stagflation era, particle production and the decay of BEC take place. The former makes the universe turn into the standard hot big bang stage and the latter makes the cosmological constant vanishingly small after the inflation. Furthermore, we calculate the density fluctuations produced in this model, which turns out to be in the range allowed by the present observational data. We also show that the stagflation is quite robust and easily appears when one allows negative region of the potential. Further, we comment on the possibility that BEC generation/decay series might have continued all the time in the cosmic history from the inflation to present.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Disordered locality as an explanation for the dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.063505	We discuss a novel explanation of the dark energy as a manifestation of macroscopic nonlocality coming from quantum gravity, as proposed by Markopoulou [F. Markopoulou (private communication)]. It has been previously suggested that in a transition from an early quantum geometric phase of the Universe to a low temperature phase characterized by an emergent spacetime metric, locality might have been ``disordered.'' This means that there is a mismatch of micro-locality, as determined by the microscopic quantum dynamics and macro-locality as determined by the classical metric that governs the emergent low energy physics. In this paper we discuss the consequences for cosmology by studying a simple extension of the standard cosmological models with disordered locality. We show that the consequences can include a naturally small vacuum energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological constant from the ghost: A toy model	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.063001	We suggest that the solution to the cosmological vacuum energy puzzle is linked to the infrared sector of the effective theory of gravity interacting with standard model fields. We propose a specific solvable two dimensional model where our proposal can be explicitly tested. We analyze the 2d Schwinger model on a 2-torus and in curved 2d space, mostly exploiting the properties of its topological susceptibility, its links with the nontrivial topology or deviations from spacetime flatness, and its relations to the real 4d world. The Kogut-Susskind ghost (which is a direct analogue of the Veneziano ghost in 4d) on a 2-torus and in curved 2d space plays a crucial role in the computation of the vacuum energy. The departure from Minkowski flatness, which is defined as the cosmological constant in our framework, is found to scale as 1/L, where L is the linear size of the torus. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the physical sector of 2d QED is represented by a single massive scalar particle, the deviation from Minkowski space is linear in L rather than exponentially suppressed as one could naively expect.

Extended general relativity: Large-scale antigravity and short-scale gravity with omega =-1 from five-dimensional vacuum	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.07.068	Considering a five-dimensional (5D) Riemannian spacetime with a particular stationary Ricci-flat metric, we obtain in the framework of the induced matter theory an effective 4D static and spherically symmetric metric which give us ordinary gravitational solutions on small (planetary and astrophysical) scales, but repulsive (anti gravitational) forces on very large (cosmological) scales with omega = -1. Our approach is an unified manner to describe dark energy, dark matter and ordinary matter. We illustrate the theory with two examples, the solar system and the great attractor. From the geometrical point of view, these results follow from the assumption that exists a confining force that make possible that test particles move on a given 4D hypersurface.

Classical tests in brane gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/26/15/155007	The vacuum solutions in brane gravity differ from those in 4D by a number of additional terms and reduce to the familiar Schwarzschild metric at small distances. We study the possible roles that such terms may play in the precession of planetary orbits, bending of light, radar retardation and the anomaly in mean motion of test bodies. Using the available data from solar system experiments, we determine the range of the free parameters associated with the linear term in the metric. The best results come from the anomalies in the mean motion of planets. Such studies should shed some light on the origin of dark energy via the solar system tests.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Relaxing a large cosmological constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.06.065	The cosmological constant (CC) problem is the biggest enigma of theoretical physics ever. In recent times. it has been rephrased as the dark energy (DE) problem in order to encompass a wider spectrum of possibilities. It is, in any case, a polyhedric puzzle with many faces, including the cosmic coincidence problem, i.e. why the density of matter rho(m) is presently so close to the CC density rho(Lambda). However, the oldest, toughest and most intriguing face of this polyhedron is the big CC problem, namely why the measured value of rho(Lambda) at present is so small as compared to any typical density scale existing in high energy physics, especially taking into account the many phase transitions that our Universe has undergone since the early times, including inflation. In this Letter, we propose to extend the field equations of General Relativity by including a class of invariant terms that automatically relax the value of the CC irrespective of the initial size of the vacuum energy in the early epochs. We show that, at late times, the Universe enters an eternal de Sitter stage mimicking a tiny positive cosmological constant. Thus, these models could be able to solve the big CC problem without fine-tuning and have also a bearing on the cosmic coincidence problem. Remarkably, they mimic the Lambda CDM model to a large extent, but they still leave some characteristic imprints that should be testable in the next generation of experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The cosmological constant as a manifestation of the conformal anomaly?	10.1088/1126-6708/2009/08/043	We propose that the solution to the cosmological vacuum energy puzzle may come from the infrared sector of the effective theory of gravity, where the impact of the trace anomaly is of upmost relevance. We proceed by introducing two auxiliary fields, which are capable of describing a diversity of quantum states via specification of their macroscopic (IR) boundary conditions, in contrast to ultraviolet quantum effects. Our investigation aims at finding a realistic cosmological solution which interprets the observed cosmological constant as a well defined deficit in the zero point energy density of the Universe. The energy density arises from a phase transition, which alters the properties of the quantum ground state. We explicitly formulate low energy gravity as an effective field theory with a precise definition of the ``point of normalization{''} as the point at which the ``renormalized cosmological constant{''} is set to zero in the Minkowski vacuum, in which the Einstein equations are automatically satisfied as the Ricci tensor identically vanishes. With this definition the effective QFT of gravity has a predictive power. In particular, it must predict the evolution of the system in any nontrivial geometry, including the vacuum energy behaviour as a function of infrared, rather than ultraviolet, input parameters.

Stellar black holes and the origin of cosmic acceleration	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.043513	The discovery of cosmic acceleration has presented a unique challenge for cosmologists. As observational cosmology forges ahead, theorists have struggled to make sense of a standard model that requires extreme fine-tuning. This challenge is known as the cosmological constant problem. The theory of gravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not suffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory vacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity. In this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show that it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the space-time metric close to the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. We then show that using the trans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole horizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon. Interestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar-mass black holes. Based on our current understanding of the black hole accretion history in the Universe, we then make a prediction for how the effective dark energy density should evolve with redshift, which can be tested with future dark energy probes.

CAN THE EXISTENCE OF DARK ENERGY BE DIRECTLY DETECTED?	10.1142/S0217751X09047028	Over the last decade, astronomical observations show that the acceleration of the expansion of the universe is greater than expected from our understanding of conventional general relativity, the mass density of the visible universe, the size of the visible universe and other astronomical measurements. The additional expansion has been attributed to a variety of phenomenon that have been given the general name of dark energy. Dark energy in the universe seems to comprise a majority of the energy in the visible universe amounting to about three times the total mass energy. But locally the dark energy density is very small. However it is not zero. In this paper I describe the work of others and myself on the question of whether dark energy density can be directly detected. This is a work-in-progress and I have no answer at present.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A

Possible scenario for MaVaN's as the only neutrino flavor conversion mechanism in the Sun	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/07/024	Mass Varying neutrino mechanisms were proposed to link the neutrino mass scale with dark energy, addressing the coincidence problem. In some scenarios this mass can present a dependence on the baryonic density felt by neutrinos, creating an effective neutrino mass that depends both on the neutrino and baryonic densities. In this article we investigate the possibility that a neutrino effective mass in matter in addition to a very small mass squared difference in vacuum (O(10(-9) eV(2))) are the main flavour conversion mechanism acting in neutrino oscillation experiments. We present a parameterization on the environmental effects on neutrino mass that produces the right flavour conversion probabilities for solar and terrestrial neutrinos experiments.

Nonsingular cosmology with a scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations from Lee-Wick theory	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.023511	We study the cosmology of a Lee-Wick type scalar field theory. First, we consider homogeneous and isotropic background solutions and find that they are nonsingular, leading to cosmological bounces. Next, we analyze the spectrum of cosmological perturbations which result from this model. Unless either the potential of the Lee-Wick theory or the initial conditions are finely tuned, it is impossible to obtain background solutions which have a sufficiently long period of inflation after the bounce. More interestingly, however, we find that in the generic noninflationary bouncing cosmology, perturbations created from quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase have the correct form to lead to a scale-invariant spectrum of metric inhomogeneities in the expanding phase. Since the background is nonsingular, the evolution of the fluctuations is defined unambiguously through the bounce. We also analyze the evolution of fluctuations which emerge from thermal initial conditions in the contracting phase. The spectrum of gravitational waves stemming from quantum vacuum fluctuations in the contracting phase is also scale-invariant, and the tensor to scalar ratio is not suppressed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmic age, statefinder, and Om diagnostics in the decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.80.023503	As an extension of the cosmological constant model (Lambda CDM), the decaying vacuum (DV) model describes dark energy as a varying vacuum whose energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter at late times, rho(Lambda)(t)proportional to H(t), and produces the matter component. We examine the high-z cosmic age problem in the DV model, and compare it with Lambda CDM and the Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) dark energy model. Without employing a dynamical scalar field for dark energy, these three models share a similar behavior of late-time evolution. It is found that the DV model, like the YMC, can accommodate the high-z quasar APM 08279+5255, thus greatly alleviating the high-z cosmic age problem. We also calculate the statefinder (r,s) and the Om diagnostics in the model. It is found that the evolutionary trajectories of r(z) and s(z) in the DV model are similar to those in the kinessence model, but are distinguished from those in Lambda CDM and the YMC. The Om(z) in the DV model has a negative slope and its height depends on the matter fraction, while the YMC has a rather flat Om(z), whose magnitude depends sensitively on the coupling.

Vacuum structure for scalar cosmological perturbations in modified gravity models	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/06/034	We have found for the general class of Modified Gravity Models f(R,G) a new instability which can arise in vacuum for the scalar modes of the cosmological perturbations if the background is not de Sitter. In particular, the short-wavelength modes, if stable, in general have a group velocity which depends linearly in k, the wave number. Therefore these modes will be in general superluminal. We have also discussed the condition for which in general these scalar modes will be ghost-like. There is a subclass of these models, defined out of properties of the function f(R,G) and to which the f(R) and f(G) models belong, which however do not have this feature.

An accelerating cosmology without dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/06/033	The negative pressure accompanying gravitationally-induced particle creation can lead to a cold dark matter (CDM) dominated, accelerating Universe (Lima et al. 1996 [1]) without requiring the presence of dark energy or a cosmological constant. In a recent study, Lima et al. 2008 [2] (LSS) demonstrated that particle creation driven cosmological models are capable of accounting for the SNIa observations [3] of the recent transition from a decelerating to an accelerating Universe, without the need for Dark Energy. Here we consider a class of such models where the particle creation rate is assumed to be of the form Gamma = beta H + gamma H-0, where H is the Hubble parameter and H-0 is its present value. The evolution of such models is tested at low redshift by the latest SNe Ia data provided by the Union compilation [4] and at high redshift using the value of z(eq), the redshift of the epoch of matter - radiation equality, inferred from the WMAP constraints on the early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect [5]. Since the contributions of baryons and radiation were ignored in the work of LSS, we include them in our study of this class of models. The parameters of these more realistic models with continuous creation of CDM are constrained at widely-separated epochs (z(eq) approximate to 3000 and z approximate to 0) in the evolution of the Universe.

Cosmological implications and structure formation from a time varying vacuum	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14713.x	We study the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) flat cosmological models in which the vacuum energy varies with time, Lambda(t). In this model, we find that the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the universe and the Hubble flow are defined in terms of exponential functions. Applying a joint likelihood analysis of the recent Type Ia supernovae data, the cosmic microwave background shift parameter and the baryonic acoustic oscillations traced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies, we place tight constraints on the main cosmological parameters of the Lambda(t) scenario. Also, we compare the Lambda(t) model with the traditional Lambda cosmology and we find that the former model provides a Hubble expansion which compares well with that of the Lambda cosmology. However, the Lambda(t) scenario predicts stronger small scale dynamics, which implies a faster growth rate of perturbations with respect to the usual Lambda cosmology, despite the fact that they share the same equation of state parameter. In this framework, we find that galaxy clusters in the Lambda(t) model appear to form earlier than in the Lambda model.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Cosmology with interaction in the dark sector	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.127302	Unless some unknown symmetry in nature prevents or suppresses a nonminimal coupling in the dark sector, the dark energy field may interact with the pressureless component of dark matter. In this paper, we investigate some cosmological consequences of a general model of interacting dark matter-dark energy characterized by a dimensionless parameter epsilon. We derive a coupled scalar field version for this general class of scenarios and carry out a joint statistical analysis involving type Ia supernovae data (Legacy and Constitution sets), measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation peaks at z = 0.20 (2dFGRS) and z = 0.35 (SDSS), and measurements of the Hubble evolution H(z). For the specific case of vacuum decay (w = -1), we find that, although physically forbidden, a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy is favored by the data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy and matter in 4 dimensions from an empty Kaluza-Klein spacetime	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.04.056	We consider the third order Lovelock equations without the cosmological constant term in an empty n(>= 8)-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime M-4 x Kn-4, where Kn-4 is a constant curvature space. We show that the emptiness of the higher-dimensional spacetime imposes a constraint on the metric function(s) of 4-dimensional spacetime M-4. We consider the effects of this constraint equation in the context of black hole physics, and find a black hole solution in 4 dimensions in the absence of matter field and the cosmological constant (dark energy). This solution has the same form as the 4-dimensional solution introduced in [H. Maeda, N. Dadhich, Phys. Rev. D 74 (2006) 021501(R)] for Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of cosmological constant, and therefore the metric of M-4 which satisfies the vacuum Lovelock equations in higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime is unique. This black hole solution shows that the curvature of an empty higher-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime creates dark energy and matter with non-traceless energy-momentum tensor in 4 dimensions.

DENSITY PERTURBATIONS IN DECAYING HOLOGRAPHIC DARK ENERGY MODELS		We study cosmological perturbations in the context of an interacting dark energy model, where the holographic dark energy with IR cutoff decays into the cold dark matter (CDM). For this purpose, we introduce three IR cutoffs of Hubble horizon, particle horizon, and future event horizon. Here we present small perturbations under the case that effective equation of state (EOS: omega(eff)) for the holographic energy density is determined to be the same negative constant as that for the CDM. Such new matter productions tend to dilute the density perturbations of CDM (matter contrast). For a decelerating universe of omega(eff) > -1/3, the matter contrast is growing as the universe evolves, while for an accelerating universe of omega(eff) < -1/3, the matter contrast is decaying, irrespective of the choice of IR cutoff. This shows clearly that the acceleration suppresses the growing of the density perturbations at the early universe.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
The cosmological constant and Pioneer anomaly from Weyl spacetimes and Mach's principle	10.1016/j.physletb.2009.03.079	It is shown how Weyl's geometry and Mach's holographic principle furnishes both the magnitude and sign (towards the sun) of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration a(p) similar to -c(2)/R(Hubble) firstly observed by Anderson et al. Weyl's geometry can account for both the origins and the value of the observed vacuum energy density (dark energy). The source of dark energy is just the dilaton-like Jordan-Brans-Dicke scalar field that is required to implement Weyl invariance of the most simple of all possible actions. A nonvanishing value of the vacuum energy density of the order of 10(-123)M(Planck)(4) is found consistent with observations. Weyl{*}s geometry accounts also for the phantom scalar field in modern Cosmology in a very natural fashion. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
The cosmological constant (a modern view)	10.1134/S1063772909050011	We briefly discuss a modern view of the cosmological constant. It is suggested that the cosmological constant was ``hardened{''} at E similar to 150 MeV after the latest (quark-gluon) phase transition. Until this energy was reached, the vacuum component of the Universe evolved (decreased) in a series of discontinuous jumps; i.e., condensates of quantum fields made negative contributions to its positive energy density. This was the quintessence period of the evolution of the Universe, when it underwent an intense loss of symmetry during the first fractions of a microsecond of its existence. However, this point of view is not without criticism, and other approaches are considered. In particular, the small value of the cosmological constant and its ability to accelerate the expansion of the Universe is of great interest. Although all available data on the cosmological constant were recently summarized and classified by S. Nobbenhuis, no satisfactory solution to this problemhas been reached, and this represents a major difficulty for progress in quantum-gravity theory and cosmology. We briefly discuss the possibility for stars to be formed from dark energy (vacuum stars) and the extension of holographic ideas to the entire Universe. We also consider the possibility of solving the problem of the cosmological constant by introducing a universal wave function; i.e., quantum decoherence, which implies the rejection of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the acceptance of H. Everett's point of view.	ASTRONOMY REPORTS
Holography, UV/IR Relation, Causal Entropy Bound, and Dark Energy		The constraint on the total energy in a given spatial region is given from holography by the mass of a black hole that just fits in that region, which leads to an UV/IR relation: the maximal energy density in that region is propotional to M(p)(2)/L(2), wher M(p) is the Planck mass and L is the spatial scale of that region under consideration. Assuming that maximal black hole in the universe is formed through gravitational collapse of perturbations in the universe, then the ``Jeans{''} scale of the perturbations gives a causal connection scale R(CC). For gravitational perturbations, R(CC)(-2) = Max ((H) over dot + 2H(2), -(H) over dot) for a flat universe. We study the cosmological dynamics of the corresponding vacuum energy density by choosing the causal connection scale as the IR cutoff in the UV/IR relation, in the cases of the vacuum energy density as an independently conserved energy component and an effective dynamical cosmological constant, respectively. It turns out that only the case with the choice R(CC)(-2) = (H) over dot + 2H(2), could be consistent with the current cosmological observations when the vacuum density appears as an independently conserved energy component. In this case, the model is called holographic Ricci scalar dark energy model in the literature.	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
THERMAL VACUUM RADIATION IN SPONTANEOUSLY BROKEN SECOND-QUANTIZED THEORIES ON CURVED PHASE SPACES OF CONSTANT CURVATURE		We construct second-quantized (field) theories on coset spaces of pseudo-unitary groups U(N+, N-). The existence of degenerated quantum vacua (coherent states of zero modes) leads to a breakdown of the original pseudo-unitary symmetry. The action of some spontaneously broken symmetry transformations destabilize the vacuum and make it to radiate. We study the structure of this thermal radiation for curved phase spaces of constant curvature: complex projective spaces CP(N-1) = SU(N)/U(N - 1) and open complex balls CD(N-1) = SU(1, N - 1)/U(N - 1). Positive curvature is related to generalized Fermi-Dirac (FD) statistics, whereas negative curvature is connected with generalized Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics, the standard cases being recovered for N = 2. We also make some comments on the contribution of the vacuum (dark) energy to the cosmological constant and the phenomenon of inflation.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMETRIC METHODS IN MODERN PHYSICS
MODIFIED BRANEWORLD COSMOLOGIES IN THE PRESENCE OF STRINGY CORRECTIONS COUPLED TO A CANONICAL SCALAR FIELD		The purpose of this paper is to study braneworld cosmologies in the presence of stringy corrections coupled to a canonical scalar field. Two independent models are explored which in their own right provide cosmologies exhibiting the present cosmic acceleration of the universe. The evolution of the cosmological scale factor is studied in four and ten-dimensional space-times. The four-dimensional model is preformed in the context of the nonminimal Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet gravity while the ten-dimensional model is constructed from the implications of Kaluza-Klein cosmology together with the Gauss Bonnet Lagrangian in the action with matter fields nonminimally coupled to gravity. Both the low energy and high energy limits are discussed for the two models and many interesting features are described in some detail.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
LRS Bianchi Type II Bulk Viscous Fluid Universe with Decaying Vacuum Energy Density I >	10.1007/s10773-008-9918-4	The present study deals with spatially homogeneous and locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type II cosmological models with bulk viscous fluid distribution of matter and decaying vacuum energy density I >. To get the deterministic models of the universe, we assume that the expansion (theta) in the model is proportional to the shear (sigma). This leads to condition R=mS (n) , where R and S are metric potentials, m and n are constants. We have obtained two types of models of the universe for two different values of n. The vacuum energy density I > for both models is found to be a decreasing function of time and it approaches a small positive value at late time which is supported by recent results from the observations of (SN Ia). Some physical and geometric behaviour of these models are also discussed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Pure gauge configurations and tachyon solutions to string field theories equations of motion	10.1088/1126-6708/2009/05/050	In construction of analytical solutions to open string field theories pure gauge configurations parameterized by wedge states play an essential role. These pure gauge configurations are constructed as perturbation expansions and to guaranty that these configurations are asymptotical solutions to equations of motion one needs to study convergence of the perturbation expansions. We demonstrate that for the large parameter of the perturbation expansion these pure gauge truncated configurations give divergent contributions to the equation of motion on the subspace of the wedge states. We perform this demonstration numerically for the pure gauge configurations related to tachyon solutions for the bosonic and NS fermionic SFT. By the numerical calculations we also show that the perturbation expansions are cured by adding extra terms. These terms are nothing but the terms necessary to make valued the Sen conjectures.

Electroweak vacua, collider phenomenology, and possible connection with dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.103003	Higher dimensional nonrenormalizable operators may modify the standard model Higgs potential in many interesting ways. Here, we consider the appearance of a second vacuum which may play an important role in cosmology. For a certain range of parameters, the usual second-order electroweak phase transition is followed by a first-order phase transition that may drive the late time accelerated expansion of the Universe. Such a potential contains kinklike solutions which in turn can play a crucial role in reconstructing the global shape of the potential in colliders, as we explicitly demonstrate.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Gauss-Bonnet chameleon mechanism of dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.103008	As a model of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe, we consider a model of the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. This model includes the propagating scalar modes, which might give a large correction to the Newton law. In order to avoid this problem, we propose an extension of the chameleon mechanism where the scalar mode becomes massive due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet term. Since the Gauss-Bonnet invariant does not vanish near the Earth or in the Solar System, even in the vacuum, the scalar mode is massive even in the vacuum and the correction to the Newton law could be small. We also discuss the possibility that the model could describe simultaneously the inflation in the early Universe, in addition to the current accelerated expansion.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Holographic Ricci dark energy: Current observational constraints, quintom feature, and the reconstruction of scalar-field dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.103509	In this work, we consider the cosmological constraints on the holographic Ricci dark energy proposed by Gao et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79, 043511 (2009)], by using the observational data currently available. The main characteristic of holographic Ricci dark energy is governed by a positive numerical parameter alpha in the model. When alpha < 1/2, the holographic Ricci dark energy will exhibit a quintomlike behavior; i.e., its equation of state will evolve across the cosmological-constant boundary w=-1. The parameter alpha can be determined only by observations. Thus, in order to characterize the evolving feature of dark energy and to predict the fate of the Universe, it is of extraordinary importance to constrain the parameter alpha by using the observational data. In this paper, we derive constraints on the holographic Ricci dark energy model from the latest observational data including the Union sample of 307 type Ia supernovae, the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background given by the five-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations, and the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The joint analysis gives the best-fit results (with 1 sigma uncertainty): alpha=0.359(-0.025)(+0.024) and Omega(m0)=0.318(-0.024)(+0.026). That is to say, according to the observations, the holographic Ricci dark energy takes on the quintom feature. Finally, in light of the results of the cosmological constraints, we discuss the issue of the scalar-field dark energy reconstruction, based on the scenario of the holographic Ricci vacuum energy.

A gravitational constant and a cosmological constant in a spin-connection gravitational gauge field theory	10.1088/1751-8113/42/15/155401	A spin-connection gravitational gauge theory with a spin-affine connection as its fundamental dynamical variable is suggested in the framework of vierbein formulation. The functional integral approach to the interaction between complex scalar matter fields and a heavy intermediate coupling field is considered, where the Einstein field equation appears as a first-integral solution to the low-energy spin-connection gauge field equation of Yang-Mills type. The most intriguing characteristics of the present scheme include: (i) the gravitational constant originates from the low-energy propagator of the heavy coupling field that mediates the gravitation between the matter fields and the spin-connection gauge field; (ii) the large cosmological constant resulting from the quantum vacuum energy actually makes no gravitational contribution since the spin-connection gauge field equation is a third-order differential equation of the metric, and an integration constant of the first-integral solution serves as an effective cosmological constant that would cause the cosmic accelerated expansion. The present mechanism for interpreting the nonzero but small cosmological constant provides a new insight into the cosmological constant problem.	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL

CAN A HYPERBOLIC PHASE OF THE BRANS-DICKE FIELD ACCOUNT FOR DARK MATTER?		We show that the introduction of a hyperbolic phase of the Brans-Dicke (BD) field results in a flat vacuum cosmological solution of the Hubble parameter H and a fractional rate of change of the BD scalar field F, which asymptotically approach constant values. At later stages, the hyperbolic phase of the BD field behaves like dark matter.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Accelerating universe in modified theories of gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.083534	We study cosmologies in modified theories of gravity considering Lagrangian density f(R) which is a polynomial function of scalar curvature (R) in the Einstein-Hilbert action in vacuum. The field equation obtained from the modified action corresponding to a Robertson-Walker metric is highly nonlinear and not simple enough to obtain analytic solution. Consequently we adopt a numerical technique to study the evolution of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. A number of evolutionary phases of the Universe including the present accelerating phase are found to exist in the higher derivative theories of gravity. The cosmological solutions obtained here are new and interesting. We study a modified theory of gravity as a toy model to explore the past and the present, and to predict the future evolution. It is found that all the models analyzed here can reproduce the current accelerating phase of expansion of the Universe. The duration of the present accelerating phase is found to depend on the coupling constants of the gravitational action. The physical importance of the coupling parameters considered in the action are also discussed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Instability of Anisotropic Cosmological Solutions Supported by Vector Fields	10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.111301	Models with vector fields acquiring a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value along one spatial direction have been proposed to sustain a prolonged stage of anisotropic accelerated expansion. Such models have been used for realizations of early time inflation, with a possible relation to the large scale cosmic microwave background anomalies, or of the late time dark energy. We show that, quite generally, the concrete realizations proposed so far are plagued by instabilities (either ghosts or unstable growth of the linearized perturbations) which can be ultimately related to the longitudinal vector polarization present in them. Phenomenological results based on these models are therefore unreliable.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS

Ghosts in asymmetric brane gravity and the decoupled stealth limit	10.1088/1126-6708/2009/03/134	We study the spectrum of gravitational perturbations around a vacuum de Sitter brane in a 5D asymmetric braneworld model, with induced curvature on the brane. This generalises the stealth acceleration model proposed by Charmousis, Gregory and Padilla (CGP) which realises the Cardassian cosmology in which power law cosmic acceleration can be driven by ordinary matter. Whenever the bulk has infinite volume we find that there is always a perturbative ghost propagating on the de Sitter brane, in contrast to the Minkowski brane case analysed by CGP. We discuss the implication of this ghost for the stealth acceleration model, and identify a limiting case where the ghost decouples as the de Sitter curvature vanishes.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS

Kinematic constraints to the transition redshift from supernovae type Ia union data	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.047301	The kinematic approach to cosmological tests provides direct evidence to the present accelerating stage of the Universe that does not depend on the validity of general relativity, as well as on the matter-energy content of the Universe. In this context, we consider here a linear two-parameter expansion for the decelerating parameter, q(z)=q(0)+q(1)z, where q(0) and q(1) are arbitrary constants to be constrained by the union supernovae data. By assuming a flat Universe we find that the best fit to the pair of free parameters is (q(0),q(1))=(-0.73,1.5) whereas the transition redshift is z(t)=0.49(-0.07)(+0.14)(1 sigma) +0.54-0.12(2 sigma). This kinematic result is in agreement with some independent analyses and more easily accommodates many dynamical flat models (like Lambda CDM).	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
No de Sitter Invariant Vacuum in Massive Gravity Theory with Ghost		In this paper, we point out that the massive gravity theory with a graviton ghost mode in the de Sitter background cannot possess a de Sitter invariant vacuum state. In order to avoid a negative norm state, we must associate the creation operator of the ghost mode with a negative-energy mode function instead of a positive-energy one as the mode function. Namely, we have to adopt a different procedure of quantization for a ghost. When a theory has a symmetry mixing a ghost mode with ordinary nonghost modes, the choice of a ghost mode is not unique. However, the quantization of a ghost is impossible without specifying a choice of ghost mode, which breaks the symmetry. For this reason, the vacuum state cannot respect the symmetry. In the massive gravity theory with a graviton ghost mode in the de Sitter background, the ghost is the helicity-0 mode of the graviton. This ghost mode is mixed with the other helicity graviton modes tinder the action of de Sitter symmetry. Therefore, there is no de Sitter invariant vacuum in such models. This leads to an interesting possibility that the non-covariant cutoff of the low-energy effective theory may naturally arise. As a result, the instability due to the pair production of a ghost and normal non-ghost particles gets much milder and that the model may escape from being rejected.	PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Particle Production in Models with Helicity-0 Graviton Ghost in de Sitter Spacetime		We revisit the problem of the helicity-0 ghost mode of a massive graviton in the de Sitter background. In general, the presence of a ghost particle, which has negative energy, drives the vacuum to be unstable through the pair production of ghost particles and ordinary particles. In the case that the vacuum state preserves the de Sitter invariance, the number density created by the pair production inevitably diverges owing to unsuppressed ultraviolet (UV) contributions. In such cases, one can immediately conclude that the model is not viable. However, in the massive gravity theory, we cannot construct a vacuum state that respects the de Sitter invariance. Therefore, the presence of a ghost does not immediately mean the breakdown of the model. Explicitly estimating the number density and the energy density of particles created by the pair production of two conformal scalar particles and one helicity-0 ghost graviton, we find that these densities both diverge. However, since models with a helicity-0 ghost graviton have no de Sitter invariant vacuum state, it is rather natural to consider a UV cutoff scale in the three-dimensional momentum space. Then, even if we take a cutoff scale as large as the Planck scale, the created number density and energy density are well suppressed. In many models, the cutoff scale is smaller than the Planck scale. In such models, the created number density and energy density are negligible as long as only the physics below the cutoff scale is concerned.	PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF MODIFIED CHAPLYGIN GAS INTERACTING WITH BAROTROPIC BACKGROUND FLUID		Based on the observation that the equation of state parameter can cross the phantom dividing omega = -1 and has a 99\% probability of being omega < -1, we introduce an interaction between the modified Chaplygin gas and the barotropic background fluid. By studying the dynamical evolution of the MCG mode with interaction and the state finder diagnostic in autonomous system, we find that the MCG vacuum-energy-dominated phase is the only stable attractor, the universe evolves from the matter-dominated phase to the MCG vacuum-energy-dominated phase, and the effect of the transfer strength parameter c is evident. In addition, we have plotted the evolution trajectories of the interacting CG, GCG and MCG models with barotropic background fluid in the state finder parameter (s - r)-plane to illustrate the discriminations among these scenarios.

Gravitational vacuum energy in our recently accelerating universe	10.1088/1742-6596/161/1/012026	We review current observations of the homogeneous cosmological expansion which, because they measure only kinematic variables, cannot determine the dynamics driving the recent accelerated expansion. The minimal fit to the data, the flat ACDM model, consisting of cold dark matter and a cosmological constant, interprets 4A geometrically as a classical spacetime curvature constant of nature, avoiding any reference to quantum vacuum energy. (The observed Uehling and Casimir effects measure forces due to QED vacuum polarization, but not any quantum material vacuum energies.) An Extended Anthropic Principle, that Dark Energy and Dark Gravity be indistinguishable, selects out flat ACDM. Prospective cosmic shear and galaxy clustering observations of the growth of fluctuations are intended to test whether the `dark energy' driving the recent cosmological acceleration is static or moderately dynamic. Even if dynamic, observational differences between an additional negative-pressure material component within general relativity (Dark Energy) and low-curvature modifications of general relativity (Dark Gravity) will be extremely small.	60 YEARS OF THE CASIMIR EFFECT
Dark energy in the local Universe		Dark energy contributes 70-75\% to the total mass/energy content of the observed Universe. Its physical nature is unknown. This is the most severe challenge to the fundamental science of XXI(st) century. High accuracy HST observations in the local Universe provide new independent evidence in favor of understanding of dark energy as vacuum with the same constant density everywhere in space.	ASTROPHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY AFTER GAMOW
Supernovae and Dark Energy		A decade ago the observations of thermonuclear supernovae at high-redhifts showed that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating and since then, the evidence for cosmic acceleration has gotten stronger. This acceleration requires that the Universe is dominated by dark energy, an exotic component characterized by its negative pressure. Nowadays all the available astronomical data (i.e. thermonuclear supernovae, cosmic microwave background, barionic acoustic oscillations, large scale structure, etc.) agree that our Universe is made of about 70\% of dark energy, 25\% of cold dark matter and only 5\% of known, familiar matter. This Universe is geometrically flat, older than previously thought, its destiny is no longer linked to its geometry but to dark energy, and we ignore about 95\% of its components. To understand the nature of dark energy is probably the most fundamental problem in physics today. Current astronomical observations are compatible with dark energy being the vacuum energy. Supernovae have played a fundamental role in modern Cosmology and it is expected that they will contribute to unveil the dark energy. In order to do that it is mandatory to understand the limits of supernovae as cosmological distance indicators, improving their precision by a factor 10.	COSMOLOGY ACROSS CULTURES

Specifically, possible contributions to it having the form of quantum vacuum fluctuations, under some conditions-corresponding to a dynamical Casimir effect at cosmological level-while playing with reasonable (partly) closed topologies of the universe and with the nature of the fields involved. We end up with some considerations on (Einstein's and generalized) gravity equations as derived from thermodynamical principles.	DARK SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE
Dark energy and fundamental physics	10.1088/1742-6596/171/1/012011	The acceleration of the expansion of the Universe which has been identified in recent years has deep connections with some of the most central issues in fundamental physics. At present, the most plausible explanation is some form of vacuum energy. The puzzle of vacuum energy is a central question which lies at the interface between quantum theory and general relativity. Solving it will presumably require to construct a quantum theory of gravity and a correspondingly consistent picture of spacetime. To account for the acceleration of the expansion, one may also think of a more dynamical form of energy, what is known as dark energy, or modifications of gravity. In what follows, we review the the basic models for dark energy and the difficulties encountered in each approach, as well as we discuss the vacuum energy problem.

The emergence of gravity as a retro-causal post-inflation macro-quantum-coherent holographic vacuum Higgs-Goldstone field	10.1088/1742-6596/174/1/012045	We present a model for the origin of gravity, dark energy and dark matter: Dark energy and dark matter are residual pre-inflation false vacuum random zero point energy (w = -1) of large-scale negative, and short-scale positive pressure, respectively, corresponding to the ``zero point{''} (incoherent) component of a superfluid (supersolid) ground state. Gravity, in contrast, arises from the 2nd order topological defects in the post-inflation virtual ``condensate{''} (coherent) component. We predict, as a consequence, that the LHC will never detect exotic real on-mass-shell particles that can explain dark matter Omega(DM) approximate to 0.23. We also point out that the future holographic dark energy de Sitter horizon is a total absorber (in the sense of retro-causal Wheeler-Feynman action-at-a-distance electrodynamics) because it is an infinite redshift surface for static detectors. Therefore, the advanced Hawking-Unruh thermal radiation from the future de Sitter horizon is a candidate for the negative pressure dark vacuum energy.

Degravitation, inflation and the cosmological constant as an afterglow	10.1088/1475-7516/2009/01/017	In this report, we adopt the phenomenological approach of taking the degravitation paradigm seriously as a consistent modification of gravity in the IR, and investigate its consequences for various cosmological situations. We motivate degravitation - where Netwon's constant is promoted to a scale dependent filter function - as arising from either a small ( resonant) mass for the graviton, or as an effect in semi-classical gravity. After addressing how the Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our attention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By considering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive graviton ( with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show that slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain quantitatively unchanged. We also find that the degravitation mechanism inherits a memory of past energy densities in the present epoch in such a way that is likely significant for present cosmological evolution. For example, if the universe underwent inflation in the past due to it having tunneled out of some false vacuum, we find that degravitation implies a remnant `afterglow' cosmological constant, whose scale immediately afterwards is parametrically suppressed by the filter scale (L) in Planck units Lambda similar to l(pl)(2)/L-2 We discuss circumstances through which this scenario reasonably yields the presently observed value for Lambda similar to O(10(-120)). We also find that in a universe still currently trapped in some false vacuum state, resonance graviton models of degravitation only degravitate initially Planck or GUT scale energy densities down to the presently observed value over timescales comparable to the filter scale. We argue that different functional forms for the filter function will yield similar conclusions. In this way, we argue that although the degravitation models we study have the potential to explain why the cosmological constant is not large in addition to why it is not zero, it does not satisfactorily address the co- incidence problem without additional tuning.

Fundamental physics on natures of the macroscopic vacuum under high intense electromagnetic fields with accelerators		High intense electromagnetic fields can be unique probes to study natures of macroscopic vacua by themselves. Combining accelerators with the intense field can provide more fruitful probes which can neither be achieved by only intense fields nor only high energy accelerators. We will overview the natures of vacua which can be accessible via intense laser-laser and intense laser-electron interactions. In the case of the laser-laser interaction, we propose how to observe nonlinear QED effects and effects of new fields like light scalar and pseudo scalar fields which may contribute to a macroscopic nature of our universe such as dark energy. In the case of the laser-electron interaction, in addition to nonlinear QED effects, we can further discuss the nature of accelerating field in the vacuum where we can access physics related with event horizons such as Hawking-Unruh radiations. We will introduce a recent experimental trial to search for this kind of odd radiations.	"LASER-DRIVEN RELATIVISTIC PLASMAS APPLIED TO SCIENCE, INDUSTRY AND

Entropy Growth in the Early Universe and Confirmation of Initial Big Bang Conditions		This paper shows how increased entropy values from an initially low big bang level can be measured experimentally by counting relic gravitons. Furthermore the physical mechanism of this entropy increase is explained via analogies with early-universe phase transitions. The role of Jack Ng's (2007, 2008a, 2008b) revised infinite quantum statistics in the physics of gravitational wave detection is acknowledged. Ng's infinite quantum statistics can be used to show that Delta S approximate to Delta N-gravitons is a starting point to the increasing net universe cosmological entropy. Finally, in a nod to similarities with ZPE analysis, it is important to note that the resulting Delta S approximate to Delta N-gravitons not equal 10(88), that in fact it is much lower, allowing for evaluating initial graviton production as an emergent field phenomena, which may be similar to how ZPE states can be used to extract energy from a vacuum if entropy is not maximized. The rapid increase in entropy so alluded to without near sudden increases to 10(88) may be enough to allow successful modeling of relic graviton production for entropy in a manner similar to ZPE energy extraction from a vacuum state.

Evolving Lorentzian wormholes supported by phantom matter and cosmological constant	10.1103/PhysRevD.79.024005	In this paper we study the possibility of sustaining an evolving wormhole via exotic matter made of phantom energy in the presence of a cosmological constant. We derive analytical evolving wormhole geometries by supposing that the radial tension of the phantom matter, which is negative to the radial pressure, and the pressure measured in the tangential directions have barotropic equations of state with constant state parameters. In this case the presence of a cosmological constant ensures accelerated expansion of the wormhole configurations. More specifically, for positive cosmological constant we have wormholes which expand forever and, for negative cosmological constant we have wormholes which expand to a maximum value and then recollapse. At spatial infinity the energy density and the pressures of the anisotropic phantom matter threading the wormholes vanish; thus these evolving wormholes are asymptotically vacuum Lambda-Friedmann models with either open or closed or flat topologies.

After that, one of the main problems in developing inflationary models has been the requirement of a very. at inflation potential. In solving this problem, supersymmetry has played a major role, and the reasons will be discussed and a specific example of the SUSY hybrid model will be examined. Some problems introduced by SUSY such as the eta and gravitino problems will then be discussed. Then in a different direction, the quintessential inflation model will be examined as a proposal where a single scalar field plays the role of both the inflaton at early time and the dark energy field later. The final topic covered is developments in understanding dissipation and particle production processes during the inflationary phase.	PRAMANA-JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
The Beginnings of a Quantum GEM Gravity Theory Based on Path Integrals		The GEM theory (Brandenburg, 2007) can be described in both its relativistically covariant and Newtonian forms. The GEM theory is an alloy of the Sakharov (1968), model of gravity as due to the quantum ZPF (Zero Point Fluctuation) and the Kaluza-Klein theory (Klein, 1926); 5(th) dimensional approach. The GEM is based on the postulate of gravity fields as arrays of ExB drifts or Poynting fields, and the postulate that both EM and gravity fields separated from each other with the formation of a 5(th) dimension coincidentally with the separation of protons and electrons. The Maxwell - Einstein equations coupled via a hydrogen plasma are recovered. A quantum theory of gravity is sketched out based on path integral methods. Gravity fields being transformable to EM fields and thus not subject to graviton high frequency instability, Planck length problems are solved by tachyon induced dark energy, to compensate for high mass densities. It is found that the classical General Relativity concept of ``no prior geometry{''} does not survive the rigors of a physically reasonable quantization, and a spacetime that is locally ``flat{''} even at short length scales results. Finally the physical meaning of the ``hidden{''} fifth dimension is discussed, where the fifth dimension is identified physically as charge. This dimension is seen as allowing the appearance of matter from the vacuum. Also the equation for the important constant that accompanies this process sigma = (m(p)/m(e))(1/2), where M(p) and M(e) are the electron and proton masses respectively and where the formula sigma congruent to In sigma(alpha(-1/2) +1)+In alpha results, will be briefly derived and discussed as allowing a lower action state for the universe.

Proposed Use of Zero Bias Diode Arrays as Thermal Electric Noise Rectifiers and Non-Thermal Energy Harvesters		The well known built-in voltage potential for some select semiconductor p-n junctions and various rectifying devices is proposed to be favorable for generating DC electricity at ``zero bias{''} (with no DC bias voltage applied) in the presence of Johnson noise or 1/f noise which originates from the quantum vacuum (Koch et at., 1982). The 1982 Koch discovery that certain solid state devices exhibit measurable quantum noise has also recently been labeled a finding of dark energy in the lab (Beck and Mackey, 2004). Tunnel diodes are a class of rectifiers that are qualified and some have been credited with conducting only because of quantum fluctuations. Microwave diodes are also good choices since many are designed for zero bias operation. A completely passive, unamplified zero bias diode converter/detector for millimeter (GHz) waves was developed by HRL Labs in 2006 under a DARPA contract, utilizing a Sb-based ``backward tunnel diode{''} (BTD). It is reported to be a ``true zero-bias diode{''}. It was developed for a ``field radiometer{''} to ``collect thermally radiated power{''} (in other words, `night vision'). The diode array mounting allows a feed from horn antenna, which functions as a passive concentrating amplifier. An important clue is the ``noise equivalent power{''} of 1.1 pW per root hertz and the ``noise equivalent temperature difference{''} of 10 degrees K, which indicate sensitivity to Johnson noise (Lynch, et al., 2006). There also have been other inventions such as ``single electron transistors{''} that also have ``the highest signal to noise ratio{''} near zero bias. Furthermore, ``ultrasensitive{''} devices that convert radio frequencies have been invented that operate at outer space temperatures (3 degrees above zero point: 3 degrees K). These devices are tiny nanotech devices which are suitable for assembly in parallel circuits (such as a 2-D array) to possibly produce zero point energy direct current electricity with significant power density (Brenning el al., 2006). Photovoltaic p-n junction cells are also considered for possible higher frequency ZPE transduction. Diode arrays of self-assembled molecular rectifiers or preferably, nano-sized cylindrical diodes are shown to reasonably provide for rectification of electron fluctuations from thermal and non-thermal ZPE sources to create an alternative energy DC electrical generator in the picowatt per diode range.

Engineering Dynamics of a Scalar Universe Part I: Theory \& Static Density Models		The notion that our universe is composed of scalar fields is becoming more of a fact as we learn more about the nature of the universe. The most appealing fact toward this is the discovery that the cosmos is expanding due to vacuum or dark energy. Cosmological expansion presents itself as a fifth force. In this paper, fifth force models are developed base on the Chameleon scalar field model presented by Khoury and Weltman that presents an alternate means of acquiring the same force results as attainable from the standard Newtonian force models. These models arc incomplete, but with further development, could lead others to develop force producing devices using unforeseen methods not visible under our current models.

DARK ENERGY, COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT AND NEUTRINO MIXING		We show that the today estimated value of dark energy can be achieved by the vacuum condensate induced by neutrino mixing phenomenon. The tiny value of dark energy is linked to the sub-eV neutrino mass scale. Contributions to dark energy from auxiliary. fields or mechanisms are not necessary in this approach.

THE HIGGS PORTAL AND AN UNIFIED MODEL FOR DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER	10.1142/S0217751X08042675	We examine a scenario where the Higgs boson is coupled to an additional Standard Model singlet scalar field from a hidden sector. We show that, in the case where this field is very light and has already relaxed to its nonzero vacuum expectation value, one gets a very stringent limit on the mixing angle between the hidden sector scalar and the Higgs field from fifth force experiments. However, this limit does not imply in a small coupling due to the large difference of vacuum expectation values. In the case that the hidden sector scalar is identified with the quintessence field, responsible for the recent acceleration of the universe, the most natural potential describing the interaction is disfavored since it results in a time-variation of the Fermi scale. We show that an ad hoc modification of the potential describing the Higgs interaction with the quintessence field may result in an unified picture of dark matter and dark energy, where dark energy is the zero-mode classical field rolling the usual quintessence potential and the dark matter candidate is the quantum excitation ( particle) of the field, which is produced in the universe due to its coupling to the Higgs boson. This coupling also generates a mass for the new particle that, contrary to usual quintessence models, does not have to be small, since it does not affect the evolution of classical field. In this scenario, a feasible dark matter density can be, under conditions, obtained.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Transition to zero cosmological constant and phantom dark energy as solutions involving change of orientation of spacetime manifold	10.1088/0264-9381/25/23/235015	The main conclusion of long-standing discussions concerning the role of solutions with degenerate metric (g equivalent to det(g(mu v)) = 0 and even with g(mu v) = 0) was that in the first-order formalism they are physically acceptable and must be included in the path integral. In particular, they may describe topology changes and reduction of the `metrical dimension' of spacetime. The latter implies disappearance of the volume element root-gd(4)x of a 4D spacetime in a neighborhood of the point with g = 0. We pay attention to the fact that besides root-g, the 4D spacetime differentiable manifold also possesses a `manifold volume measure' (MVM) described by a 4-form which is sign indefinite and generically independent of the metric. The first-order formalism proceeds with an originally independent connection and metric structures of the spacetime manifold. In this paper we bring up the question of whether the first-order formalism should be supplemented with degrees of freedom of the spacetime differentiable manifold itself, e. g. by means of the MVM. It turns out that adding the MVM degrees of freedom to the action principle in the first-order formalism one can realize very interesting dynamics. Such a two measures field theory (TMT) enables radically new approaches to the resolution of the cosmological constant problem. We show that fine tuning free solutions describing a transition to the Lambda = 0 state involve oscillations of g(mu v) and MVM around zero. The latter can be treated as a dynamics involving changes of orientation of the spacetime manifold. As we have shown earlier, in realistic scale invariant models (SIM), solutions formulated in the Einstein frame satisfy all existing tests of general relativity (GR). Here we reveal surprisingly that in SIM, all ground-state solutions with Lambda not equal 0 appear to be degenerate either in g00 or in MVM. Sign indefiniteness of MVM in a natural way yields a dynamical realization of a phantom cosmology (w < -1). It is very important that for all solutions, the metric tensor rewritten in the Einstein frame has regularity properties exactly as in GR. We discuss new physical effects which arise from this theory and in particular the strong gravity effect in high energy physics experiments.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
QUANTUM FIELD THEORY IN CURVED SPACE-TIME, THE OPERATOR PRODUCT EXPANSION, AND DARK ENERGY (Reprinted from Gen. Relativ. Gravit., vol 40, pg 2051, 2008)		To make sense of quantum field theory in an arbitrary (globally hyperbolic) curved space-time, the theory must be formulated in a local and covariant manner in terms of locally measureable field observables. Since a generic curved space-time does not possess symmetries or a unique notion of a vacuum state, the theory also must be formulated in a manner that does not require symmetries or a preferred notion of a ``vacuum state{''} and ``particles{''}. We propose such a formulation of quantum field theory, wherein the operator product expansion (OPE) of the quantum fields is elevated to a fundamental status, and the quantum field theory is viewed as being defined by its OPE. Since the OPE coefficients may be better behaved than any quantities having to do with states, we suggest that it may be possible to perturbatively construct the OPE coefficients-and, thus, the quantum field theory. By contrast, ground/vacuum states-in space-times, such as Minkowski space-time, where they may be defined-cannot vary analytically with the parameters of the theory. We argue that this implies that composite fields may acquire nonvanishing vacuum state expectation values due to nonperturbative effects. We speculate that this could account for the existence of a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of a quantum field occurring at a scale much smaller than the natural scales of the theory.

Bianchi Type-I Space-Time with Variable Cosmological Constant	10.1007/s10773-008-9752-8	A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I perfect fluid model is considered with variable cosmological constant. Einstein's field equations are solved by using a law of variation for mean Hubble's parameter, which is related to average scale factor and that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter. An exact and singular Bianchi-I model is presented, where the cosmological constant remains positive and decreases with the cosmic time. It is found that the solutions are consistent with the recent observations of type Ia supernovae. A detailed study of physical and kinematical properties of the model is carried out.

f(R) Cosmology with torsion	10.1088/0031-8949/78/06/065010	f(R)-gravity with geometric torsion (not related to any spin fluid) is considered in a cosmological context. We derive the field equations in vacuum and in the presence of perfect-fluid matter and discuss the related cosmological models. Torsion vanishes in vacuum for almost all arbitrary functions f(R) leading to standard general relativity. Only for f'(R) = R(2), torsion gives a contribution in the vacuum leading to accelerated behavior. When material sources are considered, we find that the torsion tensor is different from zero even with spinless material sources. This tensor is related to the logarithmic derivative of f'(R), which can be expressed also as a nonlinear function of the trace of the matter energy -momentum tensor Sigma(mu nu). We show that the resulting equations for the metric can always be arranged to yield effective Einstein equations. When the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models are considered, terms originated by torsion can lead to accelerated expansion. This means that, in f(R)-gravity, torsion can be a geometric source for acceleration.	PHYSICA SCRIPTA
Evolution of density perturbations in decaying vacuum cosmology: The case of nonzero perturbations in the cosmological term	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123522	We extend the results of a previous paper where a model of interacting dark energy, with a cosmological term decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter, is tested against the observed mass power spectrum. In spite of the agreement with observations of type Ia supernovas, baryonic acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background, we had shown previously that no good concordance is achieved if we include the mass power spectrum. However, our analysis was based on the ad hoc assumption that the interacting cosmological term is strictly homogeneous. Now we perform a more complete analysis, by perturbing such a term. Although our conclusions are still based on a particular, scale-invariant choice of the primordial spectrum of dark energy perturbations, we show that a cosmological term decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter is indeed disfavored as compared to the standard model.

Variable cosmological constant model: The reconstruction equations and constraints from current observational data	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2008.06.019	In this paper we first give a brief review of the variable cosmological constant model and its scalar field description. We mainly discuss two types of variable cosmological constant models: a power law and H power law models. A method to obtain all of the equivalent scalar field potentials and the effective equation of state of the two models is presented. In addition, the dynamics of such scalar field potentials and effective equation of state are discussed in detail. The parameters of the two models are constrained by current 307 high-quality ``Union{''} SN Ia data set, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 9 observational H (Z) data derived from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS) and the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) given by the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations. We also calculate and draw the picture of the Hubble parameter, the deceleration parameter and the matter density of the two models. Then, we show that the indices m and n in the two models have specific meaning in determining properties of the models. Moreover, the reasons that indices m and it may also influence the behavior of effective equation of state and scalar field potentials are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vacuum driven accelerated expansion	10.1002/andp.200810314	It has been shown that an improved estimation of the quantum vacuum energy can yield not only theoretically acceptable but also experimentally realistic results. Our idea consists in a straightforward extraction of the gravitationally interacting part of the full quantum vacuum energy by means of gauge transformations. The implementation of this idea has been performed, in the background of a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry, by means of the euclidean version of the effective action formalism, in the language of Schwinger's proper time and Seeley-DeWitt's heat kernel expansion.

IS COSMOLOGICAL ACCELERATION DRIVEN BY CLASSICAL SPACE-TIME GEOMETRY?		The homogeneous expansion history H(z) of our universe (Hubble diagram) measures only kinematic variables, it cannot fix the underlying dynamics driving the recent acceleration: cosmographic measurements of the homogeneous universe are consistent with either a static fine-tuned cosmological constant or a dynamic ``dark energy{''} mechanism, which itself may be either material dark energy or low-curvature modifications of Einstein gravity (dark gravity). This dark energy/dark gravity degeneracy in the homogeneous expansion observations can only be resolved by observing the growth of the cosmological fluctuations. However, because the ``dark energy{''} evolution is now quasistatic at most, any dynamical effects on the fluctuation growth function g(z) will be minimal. Projected observations may potentially distinguish static from dynamic ``dark energy{''	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
A cyclic model of universe with energy exchange between radiation, matter and vacuum energy	10.1007/s10773-008-9723-0	We further extend the cosmological scenario with energy exchange by Barrow and Clifton and our previous work to the more complex case with energy exchange between three fluids: radiation, matter and vacuum energy. By prescribing the form of energy exchange function, we construct an infinitely cyclic cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epoch and each consisting of expansion and contraction, and the cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble parameter H, deceleration parameter q, transition red-shift Z(T), and densities rho(r) ,rho(m) , and rho (Lambda) are consistent with the present observed values.

Stable and `bounded excursion' gravastars, and black holes in Einstein's theory of gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/11/010	Dynamical models of prototype gravastars are constructed and studied. The models are the Visser-Wiltshire three-layer gravastars, in which an infinitely thin spherical shell of a perfect fluid with the equation of state p = ( 1 - gamma)sigma divides the whole spacetime into two regions, where the internal region is de Sitter, and the external one is Schwarzschild. When gamma < 1 and Lambda not equal 0, it is found that in some cases the models represent stable gravastars, and in some cases they represent `bounded excursion' stable gravastars, where the thin shell is oscillating between two finite radii, while in some other cases they collapse until the formation of black holes occurs. However, when gamma >= 1, even with Lambda not equal 0, only black holes are found. In the phase space, the region for both stable gravastars and `bounded excursion' gravastars is very small in comparison to that for black holes, although it is not completely empty.

Accelerating cold dark matter cosmology (Omega(Lambda) equivalent to 0)	10.1088/0264-9381/25/20/205006	A new accelerating flat model with no dark energy that is fully dominated by cold dark matter (CDM) is investigated. The number of CDM particles is not conserved and the present accelerating stage is a consequence of the negative pressure describing the irreversible process of gravitational particle creation. A related work involving accelerating CDM cosmology has been discussed before the SNe observations (Lima et al 1996 Phys. Rev. D53 4287). However, in order to have a transition from a decelerating to an accelerating regime at low redshifts, the matter creation rate proposed here includes a constant term of the order of the Hubble parameter. In this case, H(0) does not need to be small in order to solve the age problem and the transition happens even if the matter creation is negligible during the radiation and part of the matter-dominated phase. Therefore, instead of the vacuum dominance at redshifts of the order of a few, the present accelerating stage in this sort of Einstein-de Sitter CDM cosmology is a consequence of the gravitational particle creation process. As an extra bonus, in the present scenario the coincidence problem does not exist which plagues models with dominance of dark energy. The model is able to harmonize a CDM picture with the present age of the universe, the latest measurements of the Hubble parameter and the supernovae observations.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
A dynamical approach to the cosmological constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2008.07.091	This Letter presents an exact analytic solution of a simple cosmological model in presence of both nonrelativistic matter and scalar field where Einstein's cosmological constant A appears as an integration constant. Unlike Einstein's cosmological constant ascribed to vacuum energy, the dark energy density and the energy density of the ordinary matter decrease at the same rate during the expansion of the universe. Therefore the model is free of the coincidence problem. Comparing the predictions using this model with the current cosmological observations shows that the results are consistent.

Phenomenology of hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/10/016	We study the phenomenology of hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark energy, where in addition to a so-called mass-varying neutrino (MaVaN) sector a cosmological constant (from a false vacuum) is driving the accelerated expansion of the universe today. For general power law potentials we calculate the effective equation of state parameter w(eff) (z) in terms of the neutrino mass scale. Due to the interaction of the dark energy field ('acceleron') with the neutrino sector, w(eff) (z) is predicted to become smaller than -1 for z > 0, which could be tested in future cosmological observations. For the scenarios considered, the neutrino mass scale additionally determines which fraction of the dark energy is dynamical, and which originates from the `cosmological-constant-like' vacuum energy of the false vacuum. On the other hand, the field value of the `acceleron' field today as well as the masses of the right-handed neutrinos, which appear in the seesaw-type mechanism for small neutrino masses, are not fixed. This, in principle, allows us to realize hybrid scenarios of neutrino dark energy with a `high-scale' seesaw where the right-handed neutrino masses are close to the GUT scale. We also comment on how MaVaN hybrid scenarios with `high-scale' seesaw might help to resolve stability problems of dark energy models with non-relativistic neutrinos.

Equilibrium boundary conditions, dynamic vacuum energy, and the big bang	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.083533	The near-zero value of the cosmological constant Lambda in an equilibrium context may be due to the existence of a self-tuning relativistic vacuum variable q. Here, a cosmological nonequilibrium context is considered with a corresponding time-dependent cosmological parameter Lambda(t) or vacuum energy density rho(V)(t). A specific model of a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe is presented, which is determined by equilibrium boundary conditions at one instant of time (t=t(eq)) and a particular form of vacuum-energy dynamics (d rho(V)/dt proportional to rho(M)). This homogeneous and isotropic model has a standard big bang phase at early times (t < t(eq)) and reproduces the main characteristics of the present universe (t=t(0)< t(eq)).	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Chemical potential and the nature of dark energy: The case of a phantom field	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.083504	The influence of a possible nonzero chemical potential mu on the nature of dark energy is investigated by assuming that the dark energy is a relativistic perfect simple fluid obeying the equation of state, p=omega rho (omega < 0, constant). The entropy condition, S >= 0, implies that the possible values of omega are heavily dependent on the magnitude, as well as on the sign of the chemical potential. For mu > 0, the omega parameter must be greater than -1 (vacuum is forbidden) while for mu < 0 not only the vacuum but even a phantomlike behavior (omega <-1) is allowed. In any case, the ratio between the chemical potential and temperature remains constant, that is, mu/T=mu(0)/T(0). Assuming that the dark energy constituents have either a bosonic or fermionic nature, the general form of the spectrum is also proposed. For bosons mu is always negative and the extended Wien's law allows only a dark component with omega <-1/2, which includes vacuum and the phantomlike cases. The same happens in the fermionic branch for mu < 0. However, fermionic particles with mu > 0 are permitted only if -1 <omega <-1/2. The thermodynamics and statistical arguments constrain the equation-of-state parameter to be omega <-1/2, a result surprisingly close to the maximal value required to accelerate a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker-type universe dominated by matter and dark energy (omega less than or similar to-10/21).

Non-existence of extended holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/09/010	The extended holographic dark energy model with the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff avoids the problem of the circular reasoning of the holographic dark energy model. We show that the infrared cutoff of the extended holographic dark energy model cannot be the Hubble horizon provided that the Brans-Dicke parameter w satisfies the experimental constraint. w > 10(4), and this is proved as a no-go theorem. The no-go theorem also applies to the case in which the dark matter interacts with the dark energy.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Basic Properties of the Einstein Equations with a Ricci-Scalar-Dependent Cosmological Term	10.1134/S1063776108090082	Basic properties of the Einstein equations modified by a cosmological Lambda-term dependent on the Ricci scalar R are considered. We show that in addition to a nonzero divergence of the energy-momentum tensor of the matter and the consequent cold matter mass nonconservation as the Universe expands, this model suggests a significant modification of the equations for the gravitational potential and particle acceleration in the Newtonian approximation. These circumstances allow the necessary criteria for possible functional dependences Lambda(R) to be formulated. Nevertheless, by introducing a variable Lambda-term, we can look at the problems of dark matter and dark energy anew. In particular, we show that the model in which the cosmological term depends linearly on the Ricci scalar (this corresponds to the approximation of a more complex dependence in the case of low matter densities) makes it possible to satisfactorily describe the rotation curves of galaxies without invoking the dark matter hypothesis and to construct a cosmological model with a variable vacuum energy density, in qualitative agreement with the present views of the early Universe.

New coupled quintessence cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.063514	A component of dark energy has been recently proposed to explain the current acceleration of the Universe. Unless some unknown symmetry in Nature prevents or suppresses it, such a field may interact with the pressureless component of dark matter, giving rise to the so-called models of coupled quintessence. In this paper we propose a new cosmological scenario where radiation and baryons are conserved, while the dark energy component is decaying into cold dark matter. The dilution of cold dark matter particles, attenuated with respect to the usual a(-3) scaling due to the interacting process, is characterized by a positive parameter epsilon, whereas the dark energy satisfies the equation of state p(x) = omega rho(x) (omega < 0). We carry out a joint statistical analysis involving recent observations from type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation peak, and cosmic microwave background shift parameter to check the observational viability of the coupled quintessence scenario here proposed.

Accelerating quantum universe		The origin of negative pressure fluid (the dark energy) is investigated in the quantum model of the homogeneous, isotropic and closed universe filled with a uniform scalar field and a perfect fluid which defines a reference frame. The equations of the model are reduced to the form which allows a direct comparison between them and the equations of the Einsteinian classical theory of gravity. It is shown that quantized scalar field has a form of a condensate which behaves as an anti-gravitating medium. The theory predicts an accelerating expansion of the universe even if the vacuum energy density vanishes. An anti-gravitating effect of a condensate has a purely quantum nature. It is shown that the universe with the parameters close to the Planck ones can go through the period of exponential expansion. The conditions under which in semi-classical approximation the universe looks effectively like spatially flat with negative deceleration parameter are determined. The reduction to the standard model of classical cosmology is discussed.	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B
Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts calibrated with Gurzadyan-Xue cosmology	10.1051/0004-6361:20078243	Context. Because gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous among known cosmic objects, they carry an essential potential for cosmological studies if properly used as standard candles. Aims. We used GRBs to test the cosmological predictions of the Gurzadyan-Xue (GX) model of dark energy, a novel theory that predicts, without any free parameters, the current vacuum fluctuation energy density close to the value inferred from the SNIa observations. We also compared the GX results with those predicted by the concordance scenario Lambda-CDM. Methods. After a consistent calibration for a specific model, using the several empirical relations obtained from GRBs observables enables one to probe current cosmological models. Based on this recently introduced method, we used several samples from different sources that fit our needs, including 69 GRBs, the recently released SWIFT satellite data, and 41 GRBs that have firmly determined redshifts. These data samples span a distance scale up to redshift about 7. Results. We show that the GX models are compatible with the Hubble diagram of the 69 GRBs sample. Such an adjustment is almost identical to the one for the concordance Lambda-CDM. From this particular analysis, we can obtain the corresponding values of the matter density parameter Omega(m) describing GX models. When the same procedure is applied to the SWIFT satellite data, we verify that the SWIFT sample does not delineate a Hubble diagram as clearly as featured by the 69 GRBs sample. Conclusions. The analysis of these 3 samples shows that more data and effort are needed to elucidate both issues: the gamma-ray bursts/standard-candle and the lack of a theoretical understanding of the physics that may explain the empirical relations.

The Universe emerging from a vacuum in loop-string cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/08/014	In this paper we study a description of the Universe based on a low energy superstring theory modified by loop quantum gravity effects. This approach was proposed by De Risi et al (2007 Phys. Rev. D 76 103531). We show that in contrast with the case for a string motivated pre-big bang scenario, the cosmological realization of the t-duality transformation is not necessary to avoid an initial singularity. In the model considered, the Universe starts its evolution in the vacuum phase at time t ->-infinity. In this phase the scale factor a -> 0, energy density. rho -> 0 and the coupling of the interactions g(s)(2)-> 0. After this stage the Universe evolves to the non- singular hot big bang phase, rho -> rho(max) < infinity. Then the standard classical Universe emerges. During the whole evolution the scale factor increases monotonically. We solve this model analytically. We also propose and solve numerically the model with an additional dilaton potential in which the Universe starts its evolution from the asymptotically free vacuum phase, g(s)(2)-> 0, and then evolves non- singularly to the emerging dark energy dominated phase with the saturated coupling constant g(s)(2)-> 0 const.

Pseudoredundant vacuum energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.043507	We discuss models that can account for today's dark energy. The underlying cosmological constant may be Planck scale but starts as a redundant coupling which can be eliminated by a field redefinition. The observed vacuum energy arises when the redundancy is explicitly broken, say by a noriminimal coupling to Curvature. We give a recipe for constructing models, including R + 1/R-type models, that realize this mechanism and satisfy all solar system constraints on gravity. A similar model, based on Gauss-Bonnet gravity, provides a technically natural explanation for dark energy and exhibits an interesting seesaw behavior: a large underlying cosmological constant gives rise to both low- and high-curvature solutions. Such models could be statistically favored in the string landscape.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Quantum fields near phantom-energy ``sudden{''} singularities	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.044041	This paper is committed to calculations near a type of future singularity driven by phantom energy. At the singularities considered, the scale factor remains finite but its derivative diverges. The general behavior of barotropic phantom energy producing this singularity is calculated under the assumption that near the singularity such fluid is the dominant contributor. We use the semiclassical formula for renormalized stress tensors of conformally invariant fields in conformally flat spacetimes and analyze the softening/enhancing, of the singularity due to quantum vacuum contributions. This dynamical analysis is then compared to results from thermodynamical considerations. In both cases, the vacuum states of quantized scalar and spinor fields strengthen the accelerating expansion near the singularity whereas the vacuum states of vector fields weaken it.

Plane symmetric thin-shell wormholes: Solutions and stability	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.044030	Using the cut-and-paste procedure, we construct static and dynamic, plane symmetric wormholes by surgically grafting together two spacetimes of plane symmetric vacuum solutions with a negative cosmological constant. These plane symmetric wormholes can be interpreted as domain walls connecting different universes, having planar topology, and upon compactification of one or two coordinates, cylindrical topology or toroidal topology, respectively. A stability analysis is carried out for the dynamic case by taking into account specific equations of state, and a linearized stability analysis around static solutions is also explored. It is found that thin-shell wormholes made of a dark energy fluid or of a cosmological constant fluid are stable, while thin-shell wormholes made of phantom energy are unstable.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Matter loops corrected modified gravity in Palatini formulation		Recently, corrections to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action were proposed to explain the current cosmic acceleration in stead of introducing dark energy. In the Palatini formulation of those modified gravity models, there is an important observation due to Arkani-Hamed: matter loops will give rise to a correction to the modified gravity action proportional to the Ricci scalar of the metric. In the presence of such a term, we show that the current forms of modified gravity models in Palatini formulation, specifically, the 1/R gravity and In R gravity, will have phantoms. Then we study the possible instabilities due to the presence of phantom fields. We show that the strong instability in the metric formulation of 1/R gravity indicated by Dolgov and Kawasaki will not appear and the decay timescales for the phantom fields may be long enough for the theories to make sense as effective field theory. On the other hand, if we change the sign of the modification terms to eliminate the phantoms, some other inconsistencies will arise for the various versions of the modified gravity models. Finally, we comment on the universal property of the Palatini formulation of the matter loops corrected modified gravity models and its implications.	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Two 3-branes in Randall-Sundrum setup and current acceleration of the universe	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.11.009	Five-dimensional spacetimes of two orbifold 3-branes are studied, by assuming that the two 3-branes are spatially homogeneous, isotropic, and independent of time, following the so-called ``bulk-based{''} approach. The most general form of the metric is obtained, and the corresponding field equations are divided into three groups, one is valid on each of the two 3-branes, and the third is valid in the bulk. The Einstein tensor on the 3-branes is expressed in terms of the discontinuities of the first-order derivatives of the metric coefficients. Thus, once the metric is known in the bulk, the distribution of the Einstein tensor on the two 3-branes is uniquely determined. As applications, we consider two different cases, one is in which the bulk is locally AdS(5), and the other is where it is vacuum. In Some cases, it is shown that the universe is first decelerating and then accelerating. The global Structure of the bulk as well as the 3-branes is also studied, and found that in some cases the solutions may represent the collision of two orbifold 3-branes. The applications of the formulas to the studies of the cyclic universe and the cosmological constant problem are also pointed out. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
Confronting the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts with Cardassian cosmology	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/07/004	We construct the Hubble diagram of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with redshifts reaching up to z similar to 6, by using five luminosity versus luminosity indicator relations calibrated with the Cardassian cosmology. This model has a major interesting feature: despite being matter dominated and. at, it can explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe. This is the first study of this class of models using high redshift GRBs. We have performed a. squared statistical analysis of the GRBs calibrated with the Cardassian model, and also combined them with both the current cosmic microwave background and baryonic acoustic oscillation data. Our results show consistency between the current observational data and the model predictions; in particular, the best fit parameters obtained from that chi(2) analysis are in agreement with those obtained from previous investigations. The influence of these best fit parameters on the redshift at which the universe would start to follow the Cardassian expansion, i.e., z(card), and on both the redshift at which the universe supposedly had started to accelerate, i.e., z(acc), and the age-redshift relation, H(0)t(0), are also discussed. Our results also show that the universe, from the point of view of GRBs, had undergone a transition to acceleration at a redshift z approximate to 0.2-0.7, which agrees with the type Ia supernovae results. One important point that we notice is that despite the statistical analysis being performed with a model that does not need any vacuum energy, we found that the results attained using this cosmological model are compatible with those obtained with the concordance cosmology (Lambda-CDM; CDM: cold dark matter), as far as GRBs are concerned. Hence, after confronting the Cardassian scenario with the GRB Hubble diagram, our main conclusion is that GRBs should indeed be considered a tool complementary to several other observational studies for doing precision cosmology.

Phantom-like behaviour in dilatonic brane-world scenario with induced gravity	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2007.12.025	The Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) model has a self-accelerating solution, the positive branch, where the brane is asymptotically de Sitter. A de Sitter space-time can be seen as a boundary between quintessence-like behaviour and phantom-like behaviour. We show that in a 5D dilatonic bulk, where the dilaton has an exponential potential, with an induced gravity term on the brane, whose matter content corresponds only to vacuum energy, the positive branch solution undergoes a phantom-like stage where it faces a curvature singularity in its infinite future. The singularity can be interpreted as the ``big rip{''} singularity pushed towards an infinite future cosmic time. The phantom-like behaviour on the brane occurs without violating the null energy condition. There is another solution, the negative branch, where the brane can undergo an early-epoch (transient) inflationary phase induced by the dilaton field. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Can quantum gravitational effects influence the entire history of the Universe?	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.023504	In this work, a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe with dust and a cosmological constant is quantized. By means of a canonical transformation, the classical Hamiltonian is reduced to that of either a harmonic oscillator or anti-oscillator, depending on whether Lambda < 0 or Lambda > 0, respectively. In this way, exact solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can easily be obtained. It turns out that a positive cosmological constant alone may account for an early inflationary regime and a later accelerated expansion phase, with a period of decelerated expansion in between. This suggests that quantum-gravitational effects can influence most of the history or even the entire history of the Universe.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Thin accretion disks in f(R) modified gravity models	10.1103/PhysRevD.78.024043	We consider the basic physical properties of matter forming a thin accretion disc in the static and spherically symmetric space-time metric of the vacuum f(R) modified gravity models. The Lagrangian of the generalized gravity theory is also obtained in a parametric form, and the conditions of the viability of the model are also discussed. The exact Schwarzschild-type solution of the gravitational field equations in the f(R) gravity contains a linearly increasing term, as well as a logarithmic correction, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild solution of general relativity, and it depends on four arbitrary integration constants. The energy flux and the emission spectrum from the accretion disk around the f(R) gravity black holes are obtained, and they are compared to the general relativistic case. Particular signatures can appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the possibility of directly testing modified gravity models by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks.

A way to get rid of cosmological constant and zero-point energy problems of quantum fields through metric reversal symmetry	10.1088/1751-8113/41/23/235401	In this paper, a framework is introduced to remove the huge discrepancy between the empirical value of the cosmological constant and the contribution to the cosmological constant predicted from the vacuum energy of quantum fields. An extra-dimensional space with metric reversal symmetry and R(2) gravity (that reduces to the usual R gravity after integration over extra dimensions) is considered to this end. The resulting four-dimensional energy-momentum tensor (obtained after integration over extra dimensions) consists of terms that contain off-diagonally coupled pairs of Kaluza-Klein modes. This, in turn, generically results in the vanishing of the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor for quantum fields, and offers a way to solve the problem of huge contribution of quantum fields to the vacuum energy density.

Cosmological Constant, Space-Time, and Physical Reality	10.1166/asl.2008.005	Quantum theory and the theory of relativity lead to sets of laws that work fantastically. Quantum field theory being accurate to about one part in 10(11), general relativity has been tested to be correct to one part in 10(14). However, if we put them together we inevitably obtain irreconcilable differences; both theories are mutually exclusive. In this article, the situation is analyzed in connection with the cosmological constant because this constant connects quantum phenomena with space-time features of general theory of relativity. It turns out that both theories have a serious vacuum (space-time) problem: within quantum field theory the energy density of the vacuum is obviously much too large and, on the other hand, the general theory of relativity does not fulfill Mach's principle. Proposals are discussed to overcome these problems.	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
Einsteinian gravity from a topological action	10.1007/s10714-007-0603-3	The curvature-squared model of gravity, in the affine form proposed by Weyl and Yang, is deduced from a topological action in 4D. More specifically, we start from the Pontrjagin (or Euler) invariant. Using the BRST antifield formalism with a double duality gauge fixing, we obtain a consistent quantization in spaces of double dual curvature as classical instanton type background. However, exact vacuum solutions with double duality properties exhibit a `vacuum degeneracy'. By modifying the duality via a scale breaking term, we demonstrate that only Einstein's equations with an induced cosmological constant emerge for the topology of the macroscopic background. This may have repercussions on the problem of `dark energy' as well as `dark matter' modeled by a torsion induced quintaxion.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Inflationary cosmology and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe in nonminimal Yang-Mills-F(R) gravity and nonminimal vector-F(R) gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.123532	We study inflationary cosmology and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe in nonminimal Yang-Mills (YM) theory, in which the YM field couples to a function of the scalar curvature. It is shown that power-law inflation can be realized due to the nonminimal YM field-gravitational coupling which may be caused by quantum corrections. Moreover, it is demonstrated that both inflation and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe can be realized in a modified YM-F(R) gravity which is consistent with solar-system tests. Furthermore, it is shown that this result can be realized also in a nonminimal vector-F(R) gravity. In addition, we consider the duality of the nonminimal electromagnetic theory and that of the nonminimal YM theory, and also discuss the cosmological reconstruction of the YM theory.

Triple unification of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy using a single field	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.121301	We construct an explicit scenario whereby the same material driving inflation in the early universe can comprise dark matter in the present universe, using a simple quadratic potential. Following inflation and preheating, the density of inflaton/dark matter particles is reduced to the observed level by a period of thermal inflation, of a duration already invoked in the literature for other reasons. Within the context of the string landscape, one can further argue for a nonzero vacuum energy of this field, thus unifying inflation, dark matter, and dark energy into a single fundamental field.

DBI-essence	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.123508	Models where the dark energy is a scalar field with a nonstandard Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic term are investigated. Scaling solutions are studied and proven to be attractors. The corresponding shape of the brane tension and of the potential is also determined and found to be, as in the standard case, either exponentials or power law of the DBI field. In these scenarios, in contrast to the standard situation, the vacuum expectation value of the field at small redshifts can be small in comparison to the Planck mass which could be an advantage from the model building point of view. This situation arises when the present-day value of the Lorentz factor is large, this property being per se interesting. Serious shortcomings are also present such as the fact that, for simple potentials, the equation of state appears to be too far from the observational favored value -1. Another problem is that, although simple stringy-inspired models precisely lead to the power-law shape that has been shown to possess a tracking behavior, the power index turns out to have the wrong sign. Possible solutions to these issues are discussed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Large scale structure formation of the normal branch in the DGP brane world model	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.124031	In this paper, we study the large scale structure formation of the normal branch in the DGP model (Dvail, Gabadadze, and Porrati brane world model) by applying the scaling method developed by Sawicki, Song, and Hu for solving the coupled perturbed equations of motion of on-brane and off-brane. There is a detectable departure of perturbed gravitational potential from the cold dark matter model with vacuum energy even at the minimal deviation of the effective equation of state w(eff) below -1. The modified perturbed gravitational potential weakens the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect which is strengthened in the self-accelerating branch DGP model. Additionally, we discuss the validity of the scaling solution in the de Sitter limit at late times.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Quintessential inflation from 5D warped product spaces on a dynamical foliation	10.1142/S0217732308025747	Assuming the existence of a 5D purely kinetic scalar field on the class of warped product spaces we investigate the possibility of mimic both an inflationary and a quintessential scenarios on 4D hypersurfaces, by implementing a dynamical foliation on the fifth coordinate instead of a constant one. We obtain that an induced chaotic inflationary scenario with a geometrically induced scalar potential and an induced quasi-vacuum equation of state on 4D dynamical hypersurfaces is possible. While on a constant foliation, the universe can be considered as matter-dominated today, in a family of 4D dynamical hypersurfaces, the universe can be passing period of accelerated expansion with a deceleration parameter nearly -1. This effect of the dynamical foliation results negligible at the inflationary epoch allowing for a chaotic inflationary scenario and becomes considerable at the present epoch allowing a quintessential scenario.

Dark energy in the environments of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the CenA group: the normalized Hubble diagram	10.1051/0004-6361:20078894	Context. Type Ia supernova observations on scales of thousands of Mpc show that the global expansion of the universe is accelerated by antigravity produced by the enigmatic dark energy contributing 3/4 of the total energy of the universe. Aims. Does antigravity act on small scales as well as large? As a continuation of our efforts to answer this crucial question we combine high accuracy observations of the galaxy flows around the Local Group and the nearby M 81 and CenA groups to observe the effect of the dark energy density on local scales of a few Mpc. Methods. We use an analytical model to describe non-uniform static space-time regions around galaxy groups. In this context it is useful to present the Hubble flow in a normalized Hubble diagram V/H(v)R(v) vs. r/R(v), where the vacuum Hubble constant H(v) depends only on the cosmological vacuum density and the zero-gravity distance R(v) depends on the vacuum density and on the mass of the galaxy group. We have prepared the normalized Hubble diagrams for the LG, M 81 and CenA group environments for different values of the assumed vacuum energy density, using a total of about 150 galaxies, for almost all of which the distances have been measured by the HST. Results. The normalized Hubble diagram, where we identify dynamically different regions, is in agreement with the standard vacuum density (Omega(v) = 0.77 h(70)(-2)), the out-flow of galaxies clearly being controlled by the minimum energy condition imposed by the central mass plus the vacuum density. A high vacuum density 1.6 h(70)(-2) violates the minimum energy limit, while a low density 0.1 h(70)(-2) leaves the start of the Hubble flow around 1-2 Mpc with the slope close to the global value obscure. We also consider the subtle relation of the zero-gravity radius Rv to the zero-velocity distance R(0) appearing in the usual retarded expansion around a mass M: in a vacuum-dominated flat universe R(0) approximate to 0.76 Rv. Conclusions. The normalized Hubble diagram appears to be a good way to present and analyze physically different regions around mass clumps embedded in cosmological vacuum. The most natural interpretation of the diagram is that the local density of the dark energy is approximately equal to the density known from studies on global scales.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Anomaly driven cosmology: big boost scenario and AdS/CFT correspondence	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/05/020	We discuss the equations governing the cosmological evolution in a recently suggested new model of quantum initial conditions for the Universe. The effective Friedmann equation incorporates the effect of the conformal anomaly of quantum fields and, interestingly, shows that the vacuum Casimir energy of those fields is completely screened and does not gravitate. The cosmological evolution also features a new mechanism for a cosmological acceleration stage. This stage is followed by a big boost singularity - a rapid growth up to infinity of the scale factor acceleration parameter. We also briefly discuss the relation between our model, the AdS/CFT correspondence and RS and DGP braneworlds.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Vacuum energy, the cosmological constant, and compact extra dimensions: Constraints from Casimir effect experiments	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.107301	We consider a universe with a compact extra dimension and a cosmological constant emerging from a suitable ultraviolet cutoff on the zero-point energy of the vacuum. We derive the Casimir force between parallel conducting plates as a function of the following scales: plate separation, radius of the extra dimension and cutoff energy scale. We find that there are critical values of these scales where the Casimir force between the plates changes sign. For the cutoff energy scale required to reproduce the observed value of the cosmological constant, we find that the Casimir force changes sign and becomes repulsive for plate separations less than a critical separation d(0) = 0.6 mm, assuming a zero radius of the extra dimension (no extra dimension). This prediction contradicts Casimir experiments which indicate an attractive force down to plate separations of 100 nm. For a nonzero extra dimension radius, the critical separation d(0) gets even larger than 0.6 mm and remains inconsistent with Casimir force experiments. We conclude that with or without the presence of a compact extra dimension, vacuum energy with any suitable cutoff cannot play the role of the cosmological constant.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Interacting cosmic fluids in power-law Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models	10.1016/j.physletb.2008.03.022	We provide a detailed description for power-law scaling Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological scenarios dominated by two interacting perfect fluid components during the expansion. As a consequence of the mutual interaction between the two fluids, neither component is conserved separately and the energy densities are proportional to 1/t(2). It is shown that in flat FRW cosmological models there can exist interacting superpositions of two perfect fluids (each of them having a positive energy density) which accelerate the expansion of the universe. In this family there also exist flat power-law cosmological scenarios where one of the fluids may have a ``cosmological constant{''} or ``vacuum energy{''} equation of state (p = -rho) interacting with the other component; this scenario exactly mimics the behavior of the standard flat Friedmann solution for a single fluid with a barotropic equation of state. These possibilities of combining interacting perfect fluids do not exist for the non-interacting mixtures of two perfect cosmic fluids, where the general solution for the scale factor is not described by power-law expressions and has a more complicated behavior. In this study is considered also the associated single fluid model interpretation for the interaction between two fluids. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B

Absence of the fifth force problem in a model with spontaneously broken dilatation symmetry	10.1016/j.aop.2007.09.003	A scale invariant model containing dilaton phi and dust (as a model of matter) is studied where the shift symmetry phi -> phi + const. is spontaneously broken at the classical level due to intrinsic features of the model. The dilaton to matter coupling ``constant{''} f appears to be dependent of the matter density. In normal conditions, i.e. when the matter energy density is many orders of magnitude larger than the dilaton contribution to the dark energy density, f becomes less than the ratio of the ``mass of the vacuum{''} in the volume occupied by the matter to the Planck mass. The model yields this kind of ``Archimedes law{''} without any especial (intended for this) choice of the underlying action and without fine tuning of the parameters. The model not only explains why all attempts to discover a scalar force correction to Newtonian gravity were unsuccessful so far but also predicts that in the near future there is no chance to detect such corrections in the astronomical measurements as well as in the specially designed fifth force experiments on intermediate, short (like millimeter) and even ultrashort (a few nanometer) ranges. This prediction is alternative to predictions of other known models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	ANNALS OF PHYSICS

Cosmology without dark energy: Weyl curvature solutions	10.1139/P08-002	To reconcile recent observations that the cosmological expansion has a positive acceleration with the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models of our Universe, as yet unseen sources of energy and (or) momentum are required for an explanation. This is due to the particular nature of spacetimes that assume homogeneity and isotropy where the curvature of the spacetime is linked to the energy-momentum content of the matter and fields in the spacetime. It is shown that more general cosmological models where Weyl (or vacuum) curvature is present can produce effects that might be responsible for the observed acceleration and other phenomena.

Constraints from the old quasar APM 08279+5255 on two classes of Lambda(t)-cosmologies	10.1007/s10714-007-0533-0	The viability of two different classes of Lambda(t)CDM cosmologies is tested by using the APM 08279+5255, an old quasar at redshift z = 3.91. In the first class of models, the cosmological term scales as Lambda(t) similar to R(-n). The particular case n = 0 describes the standard Lambda CDM model whereas n = 2 stands for the Chen and Wu model. For an estimated age of 2 Gyr, it is found that the power index has a lower limit n > 0.21, whereas for 3 Gyr the limit is n > 0.6. Since n can not be so large as similar to 0.81, the Lambda CDM and Chen and Wu models are also ruled out by this analysis. The second class of models is the one recently proposed by Wang and Meng which describes several Lambda(t)CDM cosmologies discussed in the literature. By assuming that the true age is 2 Gyr it is found that the epsilon parameter satisfies the lower bound epsilon > 0.11 while for 3 Gyr, a lower limit of epsilon > 0.52 is obtained. Such limits are slightly modified when the baryonic component is included.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION

Inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration in non-minimal Maxwell- F(R) gravity and the generation of large-scale magnetic fields	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/04/024	We study inflation and late-time acceleration in the expansion of the universe in non-minimal electromagnetism, in which the electromagnetic field couples to the scalar curvature function. It is shown that power-law inflation can be realized due to the non-minimal gravitational coupling of the electromagnetic field, and that large-scale magnetic fields can be generated due to the breaking of the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field through its non-minimal gravitational coupling. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the universe can be realized in a modified Maxwell-F(R) gravity which is consistent with solar-system tests and cosmological bounds and free of instabilities. At small curvature typical for the current universe the standard Maxwell theory is recovered. We also consider the classically equivalent form of non-minimal Maxwell-F(R) gravity, and propose the origin of the non-minimal gravitational coupling function based on renormalization-group considerations.

Relaxing neutrino mass bounds by a running cosmological constant	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/04/006	We establish an indirect link between relic neutrinos and the dark energy sector which originates from the vacuum energy contributions of the neutrino quantum fields. Via renormalization group effects they induce a running of the cosmological constant with time which dynamically influences the evolution of the cosmic neutrino background. We demonstrate that the resulting reduction of the relic neutrino abundance allows us to largely evade current cosmological neutrino mass bounds and discuss how the scenario might be probed with the help of future large scale structure surveys and Planck data.

Observational constraints on late-time Lambda(t) cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.083504	The cosmological constant Lambda, i.e., the energy density stored in the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the Universe, is the simplest and the most natural possibility to describe the current cosmic acceleration. However, despite its observational successes, such a possibility exacerbates the well-known Lambda problem, requiring a natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we study cosmological consequences of a scenario driven by a varying cosmological term, in which the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, Lambda proportional to H. We test the viability of this scenario and study a possible way to distinguish it from the current standard cosmological model by using recent observations of type Ia supernova (Supernova Legacy Survey Collaboration), measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the position of the first peak of the cosmic microwave background angular spectrum from the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

Coupled quintessence and vacuum decay	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.083516	We discuss observational consequences of a class of cosmological models characterized by the dilution of pressureless matter attenuated with respect to the usual a(-3) scaling due to the decay of vacuum energy. We carry out a joint statistical analysis of observational data from the new gold sample of 182 SNe Ia, recent estimates of the cosmic microwave background shift parameter, and baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from the SDSS to show that such models favor the decay of vacuum only into the dark matter sector, and that the separately conserved baryons cannot be neglected. In order to explore ways to more fundamentally motivate these models, we also derive a coupled scalar field version for this general class of vacuum decay scenarios.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dynamical vacuum energy via an adjustment mechanism	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.083503	A new mechanism of adjustment of vacuum energy down to the observed value from an initially huge one is considered. The mechanism is based on a very strong variation of the gravitational coupling constant in the very early universe. The model predicts that the noncompensated remnant of vacuum energy changes very slowly at late stages of the cosmological evolution and is naturally close to the observed one. Asymptotically the effective vacuum energy tends to a negative value, so the cosmological expansion should stop and turn into contraction. There remains the problem of introduction of the usual matter into the model and therefore realizing realistic cosmology.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Clustering, angular size, and dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.083505	The influence of dark matter inhomogeneities on the angular size-redshift test is investigated for a large class of flat cosmological models driven by dark energy plus a cold dark matter component (XCDM). The results are presented in two steps. First, the mass inhomogeneities are modeled by a generalized Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder distance which is characterized by a smoothness parameter alpha(z) and a power index gamma, and, second, we provide a statistical analysis to angular size data for a large sample of milliarcsecond compact radio sources. As a general result, we have found that the alpha parameter is totally unconstrained by this sample of angular-diameter data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Gravitational collapse in the context of brane world scenario with decaying vacuum energy	10.1142/S0217732308024420	An FRW brane model embedded in a conformally flat bulk is considered to study gravitational collapse for matter cloud in non-interacting combination of dark matter and dark energy. The form of dark energy is chosen as the decaying vacuum energy. Both expanding and contracting model of the universe are found for different time intervals with a time interval in between, which is a forbidden region.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
A note on the viability of Gauss-Bonnet cosmology	10.1016/j.physletb.2008.01.070	In this Letter. we analyze the viability of a vacuum Gauss-Bonnet cosmology by examining the dynamics of the homogeneous and anisotropic background in 4 + 1 dimensions. The trajectories of the system either originate from the standard singularity or from non-standard type, the later is characterized by the divergence of time derivative of the Hubble parameters for its finite value. At the onset, the system should relax to Einstein phase at late times as the effect of Gauss-Bonnet term becomes negligible in the low energy regime. However, we find that most of the trajectories emerging from the standard big-bang singularity lead to future re-collapse whereas the system beginning its evolution from the non-standard singularity enters the Kasner regime at late times. This leads to the conclusion that the measure of trajectories giving rise to a smooth evolution from a standard singularity to the Einstein phase is negligibly small for generic initial conditions.

An uneven vacuum energy fluid as Lambda, dark matter, mond and lens	10.1142/S021773230802656X	Various TeVes-inspired and f(R)-inspired theories of gravity have added an interesting twist to the search for dark matter and vacuum energy, modifying the landscape of astrophysics day by day. These theories can be together called a Non-uniform Dark Energy fluid (a Nu-Lamba fluid or a V Lambda fluid); a common thread of these theories, according of an up-to-date summary to HZL, (1) is a non-uniform vector field, describing an uneven vacuum energy fluid. The so-called ``alternative{''} gravity theories are in fact in the standard GR gravity framework except that the cosmological ``constant{''} is replaced by a nontrivial non-uniform vacuum energy, which couples the effects of Dark Matter and Dark Energy together by a single field. Built initially bottom-up rather than top-down as most gravity theories, TeVeS-inspired theories are healthily rooted on empirical facts. Here we attempt a review of some sanity checks of these fast-developing theories from galaxy rotation curves, solar system constraints, and gravitational lensing. We will also discuss some theoretical aspects of these theories related to the vacuum energy, and point out some analogies with electromagnetism and the Casimir effect.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Physics of dark energy particles	10.1007/s10701-007-9199-4	We consider the astrophysical and cosmological implications of the existence of a minimum density and mass due to the presence of the cosmological constant. If there is a minimum length in nature, then there is an absolute minimum mass corresponding to a hypothetical particle with radius of the order of the Planck length. On the other hand, quantum mechanical considerations suggest a different minimum mass. These particles associated with the dark energy can be interpreted as the ``quanta{''} of the cosmological constant. We study the possibility that these particles can form stable stellar-type configurations through gravitational condensation, and their Jeans and Chandrasekhar masses are estimated. From the requirement of the energetic stability of the minimum density configuration on a macroscopic scale one obtains a mass of the order of 10(55) g, of the same order of magnitude as the mass of the universe. This mass can also be interpreted as the Jeans mass of the dark energy fluid. Furthermore we present a representation of the cosmological constant and of the total mass of the universe in terms of `classical' fundamental constants.	FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
The return of a static universe and the end of cosmology	10.1142/S0218271808012449	We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current Lambda CDM universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that observers in our ``island universe{''} will be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe was first presented.

Cosmological implications of a scale invariant standard model	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/03/011	We consider a generalization of the standard model of particle physics such that it displays global scale invariance. The gravitational action is also suitably modified to respect this symmetry. This model is interesting since the cosmological constant term is absent in the action. We find that the scale symmetry is broken by the recently introduced cosmological symmetry breaking mechanism. This simultaneously generates all the dimensionful parameters such as Newton's gravitational constant, the particle masses and the vacuum or dark energy. We find that in its simplest version the model predicts the Higgs mass to be very small, which is ruled out experimentally. We consider a further generalization of the model such that it displays local scale invariance. This model was proposed earlier by Cheng. In this case the Higgs particle disappears from the particle spectrum and instead we find a very massive vector boson. Hence the model gives a consistent description of particle physics phenomenology as well as fitting the cosmological dark energy.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Small cosmological constant in the seesaw mechanism with broken supersymmetry	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.063518	The observed value of the cosmological constant can be naturally related to the scale of breaking down the supersymmetry in consistency with the schemes of gauge and gravity mediation in particle physics, as we argue in the framework of the static description of the phenomenological scalar field with assumed properties of its potential producing the barrier separating the flat vacuum from the anti-de Sitter state, which leads to tuned domain wall fluctuations.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy, colored anti-de sitter vacuum, and the CERN large hadron collider phenomenology	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.063006	We study the possibility that the current accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the vacuum energy density of a colored scalar field which is responsible for a phase transition in which the gauge SU(3)(c) symmetry breaks. We show that if we are stuck in a SU(3)(c)-preserving false vacuum, then SU(3)(c) symmetry breaking can be accommodated without violating any experimental QCD bounds or bounds from cosmological observations. Moreover, unless there is an unnatural fine-tuning beyond the usual cosmological constant fine-tuning, the true vacuum state of the universe is anti-de Sitter. The model can likely be tested at the LHC. A possible (though not necessary) consequence of the model is the existence of fractionally charged massive hadrons. The model can be embedded in supersymmetric theories where massive colored scalar fields appear naturally.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Is the evidence for dark energy secure?	10.1007/s10714-007-0547-7	Several kinds of astronomical observations, interpreted in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology, have indicated that our universe is dominated by a Cosmological Constant. The dimming of distant Type Ia supernovae suggests that the expansion rate is accelerating, as if driven by vacuum energy, and this has been indirectly substantiated through studies of angular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of spatial correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of galaxies. However there is no compelling direct evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy. The precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the Hubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value. The LSS data can also be satisfactorily fitted if there is a small component of hot dark matter, as would be provided by neutrinos of mass similar to 0.5 eV. Although such an Einstein-de Sitter model cannot explain the SNe Ia Hubble diagram or the position of the ``baryon acoustic oscillation{''} peak in the autocorrelation function of galaxies, it may be possible to do so, e. g. in an inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmology where we are located in a void which is expanding faster than the average. Such alternatives may seem contrived but this must be weighed against our lack of any fundamental understanding of the inferred tiny energy scale of the dark energy. It may well be an artifact of an oversimplified cosmological model, rather than having physical reality.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Dark energy and dark gravity: theory overview	10.1007/s10714-007-0549-5	Observations provide increasingly strong evidence that the universe is accelerating. This revolutionary advance in cosmological observations confronts theoretical cosmology with a tremendous challenge, which it has so far failed to meet. Explanations of cosmic acceleration within the framework of general relativity are plagued by difficulties. General relativistic models are nearly all based on a dark energy field with fine-tuned, unnatural properties. There is a great variety of models, but all share one feature in common-an inability to account for the gravitational properties of the vacuum energy. Speculative ideas from string theory may hold some promise, but it is fair to say that no convincing model has yet been proposed. An alternative to dark energy is that gravity itself may behave differently from general relativity on the largest scales, in such away as to produce acceleration. The alternative approach of modified gravity ( or dark gravity) provides a new angle on the problem, but also faces serious difficulties, including in all known cases severe fine-tuning and the problem of explaining why the vacuum energy does not gravitate. The lack of an adequate theoretical framework for the late-time acceleration of the universe represents a deep crisis for theory-but also an exciting challenge for theorists. It seems likely that an entirely new paradigm is required to resolve this crisis.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
The dynamics of quintessence, the quintessence of dynamics	10.1007/s10714-007-0550-z	Quintessence theories for cosmic acceleration imbue dark energy with a non-trivial dynamics that offers hope in distinguishing the physical origin of this component. We review quintessence models with an emphasis on the dynamics and discuss classifications of the different physical behaviors. The pros and cons of various parameterizations are examined as well as the extension from scalar fields to other modifications of the Friedmann expansion equation. New results on the ability of cosmological data to distinguish among and between thawing and freezing fields are presented.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
The cosmological constant and dark energy in braneworlds	10.1007/s10714-007-0552-x	We review recent attempts to address the cosmological constant problem and the late-time acceleration of the Universe based on braneworld models. In braneworld models, the way in which the vacuum energy gravitates in the 4D spacetime is radically different from conventional 4D physics. It is possible that the vacuum energy on a brane does not curve the 4D spacetime and only affects the geometry of the extra-dimensions, offering a solution to the cosmological constant problem. We review the idea of supersymmetric large extra dimensions that could achieve this and also provide a natural candidate for a quintessence field. We also review the attempts to explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe from the large-distance modification of gravity based on the braneworld. We use the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model to demonstrate how one can distinguish this model from dark energy models in 4D general relativity. Theoretical difficulties in this approach are also addressed.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
The cosmological constant	10.1007/s10714-007-0557-5	The energy density of the vacuum, Lambda, is at least 60 orders of magnitude smaller than several known contributions to it. Approaches to this problem are tightly constrained by data ranging from elementary observations to precision experiments. Absent overwhelming evidence to the contrary, dark energy can only be interpreted as vacuum energy, so the venerable assumption that Lambda = 0 conflicts with observation. The possibility remains that Lambda is fundamentally variable, though constant over large spacetime regions. This can explain the observed value, but only in a theory satisfying a number of restrictive kinematic and dynamical conditions. String theory offers a concrete realization through its landscape of metastable vacua.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Dynamics of perturbations in Gurzadyan-Xue cosmological models	10.1142/S021827180801195X	Perturbation theory within Newtonian approximation is presented for cosmological models with time-varying physical constants. Analytical solutions for perturbations dynamics are obtained for each Gurzadyan-Xue model with pressureless matter and radiation. It is found that perturbations grow during the entire expansion within GX models, including the curvature- and vacuum-dominated stage when they cease to grow in the standard cosmological model.

Acceleration of the universe driven by the Casimir force	10.1142/S021827180801205X	We investigate an evolutional scenario of the FRW universe with the Casimir energy scaling like (-)(1+z)(4). The Casimir effect is used to explain the vacuum energy differences ( its value measured in astrophysics is very small compared to the value obtained from quantum-field-theory calculations). The dynamics of the FRW model is represented in terms of a two-dimensional dynamical system to show all evolutional paths of this model in the phase space for all admissible initial conditions. We find also an exact solution for nonflat evolutional paths of the Universe driven by the Casimir effect. The main difference between the FRW model with the Casimir force and the Lambda CDM model is that their generic solutions are a set of evolutional paths with a bounce solution and an initial singularity, respectively. The evolutional scenario is tested by using the SNIa data, FRIIb radiogalaxies, baryon oscillation peak and CMB observation. We compare the power of explanation of the model considered and the Lambda CDM model using the Bayesian information criterion and the Bayesian factor. Our investigation of the information criteria of model selection showed preference for the Lambda CDM model over other models considered. However, the presence of the negative-like radiation term can remove a tension between the theoretical and the observed primordial He-4 and D abundance.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Dark energy, scalar-curvature couplings and a critical acceleration scale	10.1088/1475-7516/2008/02/005	We study the effects of coupling a cosmologically rolling scalar field to higher-order curvature terms. We show that when the strong coupling scale of the theory is on the 10(-3)-10(-1) eV range, the model passes all experimental bounds on the existence of fifth forces even if the field has a mass of the order of the Hubble scale in vacuum and non-suppressed couplings to SM fields. The reason is that the coupling to a certain curvature invariant acts as an effective mass that grows in regions of large curvature. This prevents the field from rolling down its potential near sources and makes its effects on fifth-force search experiments performed in the laboratory to be observable only at the submillimeter scale. We obtain the static spherically symmetric solutions of the theory and show that a long-range force appears but it is turned on only below a fixed Newtonian acceleration scale of the order of the Hubble constant. We comment on the possibility of using this feature of the model to alleviate the cold dark matter (CDM) small-scale crisis and on its possible relation to MOND.

Dark energy from gravitoelectromagnetic inflation?	10.1393/ncb/i2008-10535-5	Gravitoectromagnetic Inflation (GI) was introduced to describe in a unified manner electromagnetic, gravitatory and inflaton fields from a 5D vacuum state. On the other hand, the primordial origin and evolution of dark energy is today unknown. In this paper we show using GI that the zero modes of some redefined vector fields B-i = A(i)/a produced during inflation could be the source of dark energy in the Universe.

Evolution of density perturbations in decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.043513	We study cosmological perturbations in the context of an interacting dark energy model, in which the cosmological term decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, with concomitant matter production. A previous joint analysis of the redshift-distance relation for type Ia supernovas, barionic acoustic oscillations, and the position of the first peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background has led to acceptable values for the cosmological parameters. Here we present our analysis of small perturbations, under the assumption that the cosmological term, and therefore the matter production, are strictly homogeneous. Such a homogeneous production tends to dilute the matter contrast, leading to a late-time suppression in the power spectrum. Nevertheless, an excellent agreement with the observational data can be achieved by using a higher matter density as compared to the concordance value previously obtained. This may indicate that our hypothesis of homogeneous matter production must be relaxed by allowing perturbations in the interacting cosmological term.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
False vacuum in the supersymmetric mass varying neutrinos model	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.045015	We present detailed analyses of the vacuum structure of the scalar potential in a supersymmetric mass varying neutrinos model. The observed dark energy density is identified with false vacuum energy and the dark energy scale of order (10(-3) eV)(4) is understood by the gravitationally suppressed supersymmetry breaking scale, F(TeV)(2)/M(Pl), in the model. The vacuum expectation values of sneutrinos should be tiny in order that the model works. Some decay processes of superparticles into an acceleron and sterile neutrino are also discussed in the model.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dynamics of holographic vacuum energy in the DGP model	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.043502	We consider the evolution of the vacuum energy in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model according to the holographic principle under the assumption that the relation linking the IR and UV cutoffs still holds in this scenario. The model is studied when the IR cutoff is chosen to be the Hubble scale H-1, the particle horizon R-ph, and the future event horizon R-eh, respectively. The two branches of the DGP model are also taken into account. Through numerical analysis, we find that in the cases of H-1 in the (+) branch and R-eh in both branches, the vacuum energy can play the role of dark energy. Moreover, when considering the combination of the vacuum energy and the 5D gravity effect in both branches, the equation of state of the effective dark energy may cross -1, which may lead to the big rip singularity. Besides, we constrain the model with the Type Ia supernovae and baryon oscillation data and find that our model is consistent with current data within 1 sigma, and that the observations prefer either a pure holographic dark energy or a pure DGP model.

A test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift distortions	10.1038/nature06555	Observations of distant supernovae indicate that the Universe is now in a phase of accelerated expansion(1,2) the physical cause of which is a mystery(3). Formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressure in the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of the total energy density in the Universe. The simplest option for this `dark energy' corresponds to a `cosmological constant', perhaps related to the quantum vacuum energy. Physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of a scalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of general relativity involving higher- order curvature terms or extra dimensions(4-8). Although they produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurable differences in the growth rate of large- scale structure with cosmic time(9). A fingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, which introduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxy redshift surveys(10). Here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of 0.8. Using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies(11,12), we measure the anisotropy parameter beta=0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate of structure at that time of f = 0.9 +/- 0.36. This is consistent with the standard cosmological- constant model with low matter density and flat geometry, although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternative origins for the accelerated expansion. The correct origin could be determined with a further factor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.	NATURE
Quantum FRW cosmological solutions in the presence of Chaplygin gas and perfect fluid	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.11.013	We present a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological model in the presence of Chaplygin gas and perfect fluid for early and late time epochs. In this work, we consider perfect fluid as an effective potential and apply Schutz's variational formalism to the Chaplygin gas which recovers the notion of time. These give rise to Schrodinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale factor. We use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets and study the time dependent behavior of the expectation value of the scale factor using the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. We show that contrary to the classical case, the expectation value of the scale factor avoids singularity at quantum level. Moreover, this model predicts that the expansion of Universe is accelerating for the late times. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Current constraints on interacting holographic dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.10.061	Although there is mounting observational evidence that the cosmic expansion is undergoing a late-time acceleration, the physical mechanism behind such a phenomenon is yet unknown. In this Letter, we investigate a holographic dark energy (HDE) model with interaction between the components of the dark sector in the light of current cosmological observations. We use both the new gold sample of 182 type Ia supemovae (SNe Ia) and the 192 SNe Ia ESSENCE data, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the shift parameter from the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. In agreement with previous results, we show that these observations suggest a very weak coupling or even a noninteracting HDE.

The Visible Integral-Field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) is an instrument comprising approximately 150 individual IFU-fed spectrographs which will be mounted on the telescope structure. Each spectrograph has a CDD camera detector package which must be cryogenically cooled during scientific operation.

Dark energy and the accelerating universe	10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243	Ten years ago, the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating put in place the last major building block of the present cosmological model, in which the universe is composed of 4\% baryons, 20\% dark matter, and 76\% dark energy. At the same time, it posed one of the most profound mysteries in all of science, with (feel) connections to both astrophysics and particle physics. Cosmic acceleration could arise from the repulsive gravity of dark energy-for example, the quantum energy of the vacuum-or it may signal that general relativity (GR) breaks down on cosmological scales and must be replaced. We review the present observational evidence for cosmic acceleration and what it has revealed about dark energy, discuss the various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain acceleration, and describe the key observational probes that will shed light on this enigma in the coming years.

Constraining Bouncing Cosmology Caused by the Casimir Effect	10.1134/S0202289308010039	We constrain the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model with a ``radiation-like{''} contribution to the Friedmann equation against the astronomical data. We analyze the observational bounds on a (1 + z)(4) term from type Ia supernovae (SNIa) data, Fanaroff-Riley type IIb (FRIIb) radio galaxy (RG) data, baryon oscillation peak and cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) observations. We argue that it is not possible to determine the energy densities of individual components scaling like radiation from a kinematic astronomical test. The bounds for the density parameter of the total radiation-like term can be obtained. We find different interpretations of the presence of a scaling-like radiation term: the FRW universe filled with a massless scalar field in a quantum regime (the Casimir effect), the FRW model in a semiclassical approximation of loop quantum gravity, the FRW model in the Randall-Sundrum scenario with dark radiation or a cosmological model with global rotation. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on the Casimir effect arising from quantum effects of a scalar field. This contribution can describe a decaying part of the cosmological constant. We discuss the back-reaction of gravity on the Casimir-type force which is a manifestation of the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum scalar field at low temperature. It is shown that, while the Casimir energy gives rise to the accelerating Universe, the cosmological constant term is still required. We argue that a small negative contribution of a radiation-like term can reconcile the tension between the observed primordial (4)He and D abundances. Moreover, the presence of such a contribution can also remove the disagreement between the Hubble parameter H(0) values obtained from the SNIa and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite data.

VIRUS-P: Camera Design and Performance	10.1117/12.790099	We present the design and performance of the prototype Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS-P) camera. Commissioned in 2007, VIRUS-P is the prototype for 150+ identical fiber-fed integral field spectrographs for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment. With minimal complexity, the gimbal mounted, double-Schmidt design achieves high on-sky throughput, image quality, contrast, and stability with novel optics, coatings, baffling, and minimization of obscuration. The system corrector working for both the collimator and f/1.33 vacuum Schmidt camera serves as the cryostat window while a 49 mm square aspheric field flattener sets the central obscuration. The mount, electronics, and cooling of the 2k X 2k, Fairchild Imaging CCD3041-BI fit in the field-flattener footprint. Ultra-black knife edge baffles at the corrector, spider, and adjustable mirror, and a detector mask, match the optical footprints at each location and help maximize the 94\% contrast between 245 spectra. An optimally stiff and light symmetric four vane stainless steel spider supports the CCD which is thermally isolated with an equally stiff Ultem-1000 structure. The detector/field flattener spacing is maintained to 1 mu m for all camera orientations and repeatably reassembled to 12 mu m. Invar rods in tension hold the camera focus to +/-4 mu m over a -5-25 degrees C temperature range. Delivering a read noise of 4.2 e(-) RMS, sCTE of 1-10(-5), and pCTE of 1-10(-6) at 100 kpix/s, the McDonald V2 controller also helps to achieve a 38 hr hold time with 3 L of LN2 while maintaining the detector temperature setpoint to 150 mu K (5 sigma RMS).

Electromagnetic dark energy	10.1142/S0218271808011870	We introduce a new model for dark energy in the Universe in which a small cosmological constant is generated by ordinary electromagnetic vacuum energy. The corresponding virtual photons exist at all frequencies but switch from a gravitationally active phase at low frequencies to a gravitationally inactive phase at higher frequencies via a Ginzburg-Landau type of phase transition. Only virtual photons in the gravitationally active state contribute to the cosmological constant. A small vacuum energy density, consistent with astronomical observations, is naturally generated in this model. We propose possible laboratory tests for such a scenario based on phase synchronization in superconductors.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Dark energy as a relic of the vacuum-energy cancellation?	10.1142/S0218271808011900	We analyze the dynamical implications of an exponential Lagrangian density for the gravitational field, as referred to an isotropic FRW Universe. Then, we discuss the features of the generalized de Sitter phase, predicted by the new Friedmann equation. The existence of a consistent de Sitter solution arises only if the ratio between the vacuum energy density and that associated with the fundamental length of the theory acquires a tantalizing negative character. This choice allows us to explain the present Universe dark energy as a relic of the vacuum-energy cancellation due to the cosmological constant intrinsically contained in our scheme. The corresponding scalar-tensor description of the model is addressed too, and the behavior of the scalar field is analyzed for both negative and positive values of the cosmological term. In the first case, the Friedmann equation is studied both in vacuum and in the presence of external matter, while, in the second case, the quantum regime is approached in the framework of ``repulsive{''} properties of the gravitational interaction, as described in recent issues in loop quantum cosmology. In particular, in the vacuum case, we find a pure non-Einsteinian effect, according to which a negative cosmological constant provides an accelerating de Sitter dynamics, in the region where the series expansion of the exponential term does not hold.

Stellar configurations in f(R) theories of gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.024040	We study stellar configurations and the space-time around them in metric f(R) theories of gravity. In particular, we focus on the polytropic model of the Sun in two specific cases: the f(R) = R - mu(4)/R model and a model with a stabilizing higher order term f(R) = R - mu(4)/R + beta R(3)/(3 mu(4)). We show how the stellar configuration in the f(R) theory can, by appropriate initial conditions, be selected to be equal to that described by the Lane-Emden equation and how a simple scaling relation exists between the solutions. We also derive the correct solution analytically near the center of the star in f(R) theory. Previous analytical and numerical results are confirmed, indicating that the space-time around the Sun is incompatible with solar system constraints in the f(R) = R - mu(4)/R model. Numerical work shows that stellar configurations, with a regular metric at the center, lead to gamma(PPN) similar or equal to 1/2 outside the star for both models, i.e., the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time is not the correct vacuum solution for such configurations. This shows that even when one fine-tunes the initial conditions inside a star such that the mass of the effective scalar in the equivalent scalar-tensor theory is large, gamma(PPN) is still 1/2 outside the star. Conversely, by selecting the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric as the outside solution, or equivalently setting the mass of the effective scalar to be large outside the star, we find that the stellar configuration is unchanged but the metric is irregular at the center. The possibility of constructing a f(R) theory compatible with the solar system experiments and possible new constraints arising from the radius-mass relation of stellar objects is discussed.

Anisotropic cosmological constant and the CMB quadrupole anomaly	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.023534	There are evidences that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) large-angle anomalies imply a departure from statistical isotropy and hence from the standard cosmological model. We propose a Lambda CDM model extension whose dark energy component preserves its nondynamical character but wields anisotropic vacuum pressure. Exact solutions for the cosmological scale factors are presented, upper bounds for the deformation parameter are evaluated and its value is estimated considering the elliptical universe proposal to solve the quadrupole anomaly. This model can be constructed from a Bianchi I cosmology with a cosmological constant from two different ways: (i) a straightforward anisotropic modification of the vacuum pressure consistently with energy-momentum conservation; (ii) a Poisson structure deformation between canonical momenta such that the dynamics remain invariant under scale factors rescalings.

Constraining the dark energy and smoothness parameter with supernovae	10.1103/PhysRevD.77.023519	The presence of inhomogeneities modifies the cosmic distances through the gravitational lensing effect, and, indirectly, must affect the main cosmological tests. Assuming that the dark energy is a smooth component, the simplest way to account for the influence of clustering is to suppose that the average evolution of the expanding Universe is governed by the total matter-energy density whereas the focusing of light is only affected by a fraction of the total matter density quantified by the alpha Dyer-Roeder parameter. By using two different samples of SNe type Ia data, the Omega(m) and alpha parameters are constrained by applying the Zeldovich-Kantowski-Dyer-Roeder luminosity distance-redshift relation for a flat (Lambda CDM) model. Lambda chi(2)-analysis using the 115 SNe Ia data of the Astier et al. sample (2006) constrains the density parameter to be Omega(m)=0.26(-0.07)(+0.17) (2 sigma) while the alpha parameter is weakly limited (all the values is an element of[0,1] are allowed even at 1 sigma). However, a similar analysis based the 182 SNe Ia data of Riess et al. (2007) constrains the pair of parameters to be Omega(m)=0.33(-0.07)(+0.09) and alpha >= 0.42 (2 sigma). Basically, this occurs because the Riess et al. sample extends to appreciably higher redshifts. As a general result, even considering the existence of inhomogeneities as described by the smoothness alpha parameter, the Einstein-de Sitter model is ruled out by the two samples with a high degree of statistical confidence (11.5 sigma and 9.9 sigma, respectively). The inhomogeneous Hubble-Sandage diagram discussed here highlights the necessity of the dark energy, and a transition deceleration/accelerating phase at z similar to 0.5 is also required.

Propulsion in the Chameleon model		The Chameleon model - thin-shell mechanism - proposed by Khoury and Weltman presents a likeness to a stationary warp bubble about masses of significant size and interest to space propulsion. A difference being that the thin-shell mechanism masks the mass of an object from an external Chameleon field comparable to the gravitational field in warp-drive theory. However, the thin-shell mechanism couples to the gravitational field by causing small perturbations limited to an object's effective range, which in essence could act like a warp-bubble under some ``yet to be defined{''} conditions where the coupling is made stronger. In this paper. the thin-shell mechanism is discussed and shown to be the underlying physics behind rocket propulsion through the concept of localized oscillating dark matter comprising an increase in the thin-shell localized to a region on one side of an object. This is accomplished by drawing a connection between the localized oscillation of dark matter in this thin-shell region and the rocket equations. As such, it appears that a new physics effect is applied to normal matter; indicating that the results should have been observed decades ago. We argue that the Chameleon Model's thin-shell mechanism is a dark matter/energy field, which has always been in all momentum systems at or above the atomic scale where the mass has some physical significance in respect to the Chameleon model. Therefore. its physical (momentum) effects have already been observed. Further, since the analysis indicates that any motion of an object implies a change to the distribution of dark matter about an object. one can speculate that ``inertia is the change in the dark energy distribution about a mass.{''} This being the case. the Chameleon dark matter/energy field about a mass has effects in many aspects of physics, but the laws have not (yet) been formulated to take advantage of the vacuum field aspects, which may provide the connection needed to extend modem rocketry to propellantless space drives.

The cosmic coincidence as a temporal selection effect produced by the age distribution of terrestrial planets in the universe	10.1086/522197	The energy densities of matter and the vacuum are currently observed to be of the same order of magnitude: (Omega(m0) approximate to 0.3) similar to (Omega(Lambda 0) approximate to 0.7). The cosmological window of time during which this occurs is relatively narrow. Thus, we are presented with the cosmological coincidence problem.why, just now, do these energy densities happen to be of the same order? Here we show that this apparent coincidence can be explained as a temporal selection effect produced by the age distribution of terrestrial planets in the universe. We find a large (similar to 68\%) probability that observations made from terrestrial planets will result in finding Omega(m) at least as close to Omega(Lambda) as we observe today. Hence, we, and any observers in the universe who have evolved on terrestrial planets, should not be surprised to find Omega(m0) similar to Omega(Lambda 0). This result is relatively robust if the time it takes an observer to evolve on a terrestrial planet is less than similar to 10 Gyr.	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
Astrophysical configurations with background cosmology: probing dark energy at astrophysical scales	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12383.x	We explore the effects of a positive cosmological constant on astrophysical and cosmological configurations described by a polytropic equation of state. We derive the conditions for equilibrium and stability of such configurations and consider some astrophysical examples where our analysis may be relevant. We show that in the presence of the cosmological constant the isothermal sphere is not a viable astrophysical model since the density in this model does not go asymptotically to zero. The cosmological constant implies that, for a polytropic index smaller than 5, the central density has to exceed a certain minimal value in terms of the vacuum density in order to guarantee the existence of a finite-size object. We examine such configurations together with effects of Lambda in other exotic possibilities, such as neutrino and boson stars, and we compare our results to N-body simulations. The astrophysical properties and configurations found in this paper are specific features resulting from the existence of a dark energy component. Hence, if found in nature they would be an independent probe of a cosmological constant, complementary to other observations.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Chasing lambda	10.1393/ncb/i2008-10488-7	Recent astronomical observations of SNIa, CMB, as well as BAO in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, suggest that the current Universe has entered a stage of an accelerated expansion with the transition redshift at z similar or equal to 0.5. While the simplest candidates to explain this fact is cosmological constant/vacuum energy, there exists a serious problem of coincidence. In theoretical cosmology we can find many possible approaches alleviating this problem by applying new physics or other conception of dark energy. We consider state-of-art candidates for the description of accelerating Universe in the framework of the Bayesian model selection. We point out advantages as well as troubles of this approach. We find that the combination of four data bases gives a stringent posterior probability of the ACDM model which is 74\%. This fact is a quantitative exemplification of a turmoil in modern cosmology over the A problem.	NUOVO CIMENTO DELLA SOCIETA ITALIANA DI FISICA B-BASIC TOPICS IN PHYSICS
Gravastar energy conditions revisited	10.1088/0264-9381/24/22/022	We consider the gravastar model where the vacuum phase transition between the de Sitter interior and the Schwarzschild or Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior geometries takes place at a single spherical delta-shell. We derive sharp analytic bounds on the surface compactness (2m/ r) that follow from the requirement that the dominant energy condition (DEC) holds at the shell. In the case of Schwarzschild exterior, the highest surface compactness is achieved with the stiff shell in the limit of vanishing (dark) energy density in the interior. In the case of Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior, in addition to the gravastar configurations with the shell under surface pressure, gravastar configurations with vanishing shell pressure (dust shells), as well as configurations with the shell under surface tension, are allowed by the DEC. Respective bounds on the surface compactness are derived for all cases. We also consider the speed of sound on the shell as derived from the requirement that the shell is stable against the radial perturbations. The causality requirement (sound speed not exceeding that of light) further restricts the space of allowed gravastar configurations.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Cosmic acceleration, dark energy, and fundamental physics	10.1143/JPSJ.76.111015	A web of interlocking observations has established that the expansion of the Universe is speeding up and not slowing, revealing the presence of some form of repulsive gravity. Within the context of general relativity the cause of cosmic acceleration is a highly elastic (p similar to -rho), very smooth form of energy called ``dark energy{''} accounting for about 75\% of the Universe. The ``simplest{''} explanation for dark energy is the zero-point energy density associated with the quantum vacuum; however, all estimates for its value are many orders-of-magnitude too large. Other ideas for dark energy include a very light scalar field or a tangled network of topological defects. An alternate explanation invokes gravitational physics beyond general relativity. Observations and experiments underway and more precise cosmological measurements and laboratory experiments planned for the next decade will test whether or not dark energy is the quantum energy of the vacuum or something more exotic, and whether or not general relativity can self consistently explain cosmic acceleration. Dark energy is the most conspicuous example of physics beyond the standard model and perhaps the most profound mystery in all of science.	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
Dark energy from vacuum fluctuations	10.1016/j.nuclphysbps.2007.08.056	We describe briefly a novel interpretation of the physical nature of dark energy (DE), based on the vacuum fluctuations model by Gurzadyan & Xue, and describe an internally consistent solution for the behavor of DE as a function of redshift. A key choice is the nature of the upper bound used for the computation of energy density contributions by vacuum modes. We show that use of the comoving horizon radius produces a viable model, whereas use of the proper horizon radius is inconsistent with the observations. After introduction of a single phenomenological parameter, the model is consistent with all of the curently available data, and fits them as well as the standard cosmological constant model, while making testable predictions. While some substantial interpretative uncertainties remain, future developments of this model may lead to significant new insights into the physical nature of DE.	
Variation of the fundamental constants: Theory and observations	10.1142/S0217751X07038293	Review of recent works devoted to the variation of the. ne structure constant a, strong interaction and fundamental masses (Higgs vacuum) is presented. The results from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, quasar absorption spectra, and Oklo natural nuclear reactor data give us the space-time variation on the Universe lifetime scale. Comparison of different atomic clocks gives us the present time variation. Assuming linear variation with time we can compare different results. The best limit on the variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio mu = m(e)/M-p and X-e = m(e)/Lambda QCD follows from the quasar absorption spectra:(1) (mu) over dot/mu = (X)over dot(e)/X-e = (1 +/- 3) x 10(-16) yr(-1). A combination of this result and the atomic clock results(2,3) gives the best limt on variation of alpha: (alpha)over dot/alpha = (-0.8 +/- 0.8) x 10(-16) yr(-1). The Oklo natural reactor gives the best limit on the variation of X-s = m(s)/Lambda QCD where m(s) is the strange quark mass:(4,5) |(X)over dot(s)/X-s| < 10(-18) yr(-1). Note that the Oklo data can not give us any limit on the variation of a since the effect of a there is much smaller than the effect of X-s and should be neglected. Huge enhancement of the relative variation e. ects happens in transitions between close atomic, molecular and nuclear energy levels. We suggest several new cases where the levels are very narrow. Large enhancement of the variation e. ects is also possible in cold atomic and molecular collisions near Feshbach resonance. How changing physical constants and violation of local position invariance may occur? Light scalar fields very naturally appear in modern cosmological models, affecting parameters of the Standard Model (e.g. alpha). Cosmological variations of these scalar. fields should occur because of drastic changes of matter composition in Universe: the latest such event is rather recent (about 5 billion years ago), from matter to dark energy domination. Massive bodies (stars or galaxies) can also affect physical constants. They have large scalar charge S proportional to number of particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar field U = S/r. This leads to a variation of the fundamental constants proportional to the gravitational potential, e.g. delta alpha/alpha = k alpha delta(GM/rc(2)). We compare different manifestations of this effect. The strongest limits(6) k alpha + 0.17k(e) = (-3.5 +/- 6) x 10(-7) and k alpha + 0.13k(q) = (-1 +/- 17) x 10(-7) are obtained from the measurements of dependence of atomic frequencies on the distance from Sun(2,7) (the distance varies due to the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit).

Flat cosmology with coupled matter and dark energy	10.1086/521356	Three models of a flat universe of coupled matter and dark energy with different low- redshift parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state are considered. The dark energy is assumed to vary with time like the trace of the energy- momentum tensor of cosmic matter. In the radiation- dominated era the models reduce to standard cosmology. In the matter- dominated era they are, for modern values of the cosmological parameters, consistent with data from Type Ia supernova searches and with the data of Gurvits et al. for the angular sizes of ultracompact radio sources. We find that the angular size - redshift tests for our models offer a higher statistical confidence than that based on SNe Ia data. A comparison of our results with a recent revised analysis of angular size - redshift legacy data is made, and the implication of our models with optimized relativistic beaming in the radio sources is discussed. In particular, we find that relativistic beaming implies a Lorentz factor less than 6, in agreement with its values for powerful active galactic nuclei.	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
Remarks on the formulation of the cosmological constant/dark energy problems	10.1007/s10701-007-9175-z	Associated with the cosmic acceleration are the old and new cosmological constant problems, recently put into the more general context of the dark energy problem. In broad terms, the old problem is related to an unexpected order of magnitude of this component while the new problem is related to this magnitude being of the same order of the matter energy density during the present epoch of cosmic evolution. Current plans to measure the equation of state or density parameters certainly constitute an important approach; however, as we discuss, this approach is faced with serious feasibility challenges and is limited in the type of conclusive answers it could provide. Therefore, is it really too early to seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems? In view of the difficulty of this endeavor, we argue in this work that a good place to start is by questioning some of the assumptions underlying the formulation of these problems and finding new ways to put this questioning to the test. First, we calculate how much fine tuning the cosmic coincidence problem represents. Next, we discuss the potential of some cosmological probes such as weak gravitational lensing to identify novel tests to probe dark energy questions and assumptions and provide an example of consistency tests. Then, motivated by some theorems in General Relativity, we discuss if the full identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy is unquestionable. We discuss some implications of the simplest solution for the principles of General Relativity. Also, we point out the relevance of experiments at the interface of astrophysics and quantum field theory, such as the Casimir effect in gravitational and cosmological contexts. We conclude that challenging some of the assumptions underlying the cosmological constant problems and putting them to the test may prove useful and necessary to make progress on these questions.

Stealth acceleration and modified gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/10/006	We show how to construct consistent braneworld models which exhibit late time acceleration. Unlike self-acceleration, which has a de Sitter vacuum state, our models have the standard Minkowski vacuum and accelerate only in the presence of matter, which we dub `stealth acceleration'. We use an effective action for the brane which includes an induced gravity term, and allow for an asymmetric set-up. We study the linear stability of. at brane vacua and find the regions of parameter space where the set-up is stable. The four-dimensional graviton is only quasi-localized in this set-up and as a result gravity is modified at late times. One of the two regions is strongly coupled and the scalar mode is eaten up by an extra symmetry that arises in this limit. Having filtered the well-defined theories we then focus on their cosmology. When the graviton is quasi-localized we find two main examples of acceleration. In each case, we provide an illustrative model and compare it to Lambda CDM.

The Casimir effect for parallel plates revisited	10.1063/1.2794562	The Casimir effect for a massless scalar field with Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions (bc's) on infinite parallel plates is revisited in the local quantum field theory (lqft) framework introduced by Kay [Phys. Rev. D 20, 3052 (1979)]. The model displays a number of more realistic features than the ones he treated. In addition to local observables, as the energy density, we propose to consider intensive variables, such as the energy per unit area epsilon, as fundamental observables. Adopting this view, lqft rejects Dirichlet (the same result may be proved for Neumann or mixed) bc, and accepts periodic bc: in the former case epsilon diverges, in the latter it is finite, as is shown by an expression for the local energy density obtained from lqft through the use of the Poisson summation formula. Another way to see this uses methods from the Euler summation formula: in the proof of regularization independence of the energy per unit area, a regularization-dependent surface term arises upon use of Dirichlet bc, but not periodic bc. For the conformally invariant scalar quantum field, this surface term is absent due to the condition of zero trace of the energy momentum tensor, as remarked by De Witt [Phys. Rep. 19, 295 (1975)]. The latter property does not hold in the application to the dark energy problem in cosmology, in which we argue that periodic bc might play a distinguished role.

Constraining interacting dark energy models with flux destabilization	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.07.058	A destabilization in the transfer energy flux from the vacuum to radiation, for two vacuum decay laws relevant to the dark energy problem, is analyzed using the Landau-Lifshitz fluctuation hydrodynamic theory. Assuming thermal (or near thermal) equilibrium between the vacuum and radiation, at the earliest epoch of the Universe expansion, we show that the law due to renormalization-group running of the cosmological constant term, with parameters chosen not to spoil the primordial nucleosynthesis scenario, does soon drive the flux to fluctuate beyond its statistical average value thereby distorting the cosmic background radiation spectrum beyond observational limits. While the law coming from the saturated holographic dark energy does not lead the flux to wildly fluctuate, a more realistic non-saturated form shows again such anomalous behavior.

Relativistic modified Newtonian dynamics from string theory?	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.07.004	We argue that TeVeS-like vector fields appear naturally in certain string theory backgrounds involving D0-branes, as a result of the recoil velocity field, expressing the interaction of neutrino string matter with point-like branes. However, the similarity with TeVeS models is restricted only to the bi-metric properties of space-time, namely the difference of the background metric from the one felt by (some) matter fields interacting, in a topologically non-trivial manner, with the D0-brane defects. In our approach, neutrinos appear as dark matter candidates that could be ``captured{''} by the D0-branes, as a result of stringy properties, and thus couple with the recoil-vector fields. Moreover, we argue in support of a possibly preferential role of neutrinos in inducing novel non-perturbative contributions to ``vacuum{''} (dark) energy, in addition to their ordinary dark matter contribution. In fact, the role of neutrinos as providing substantial contributions to dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe, suggested by our approach, appears also to be necessitated by the need to reproduce the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum, as claimed recently in the literature. Thus, our framework may be viewed as providing a microscopic explanation of such phenomenological conclusions concerning TeVeS-like, Lorentz-violating models. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

At the heart of this review is a new analysis of the conceptual problem of time and the closely related and phenomenologically relevant problem of vacuum energy in quantum gravity.

Dark energy from vacuum entanglement	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/08/005	We suggest that vacuum entanglement energy associated with the entanglement entropy of the universe is the origin of dark energy. The observed properties of dark energy can be explained by using the nature of entanglement energy without modi. cation of gravity or exotic matter. From the number of degrees of freedom in the standard model, we obtain the equation of state parameter omega(0)(Lambda) similar or equal to- 0.93 and d similar or equal to 0.95 for the holographic dark energy, which are consistent with current observational data at the 95\% confidence level.

Ultraviolet stable, Lorentz-violating dark energy with transient phantom era	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/08/010	Phantom fields with negative kinetic energy are often plagued by vacuum quantum instability in the ultraviolet region. We present a Lorentzviolating dark energy model free from this problem and show that the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary omega = - 1 to the phantom equation of state is realized before reaching a de Sitter attractor. Another interesting feature is a peculiar time dependence of the effective Newton's constant; the magnitude of this effect is naturally small but may be close to experimental limits. We also derive momentum scales of instabilities at which tachyons or ghosts appear in the infrared region around the present Hubble scale and clarify the conditions under which tachyonic instabilities do not spoil the homogeneity of the present/ future Universe.

Quantum stability of a w <-1 phase of cosmic acceleration	10.1103/PhysRevD.76.043512	We consider a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction which is released in Bunch-Davies vacuum in the locally de Sitter background of an inflating universe. It was shown, in this system, that quantum effects can induce a temporary phase of superacceleration, causing a violation of the weak energy condition on cosmological scales. In this paper, we investigate the system's stability by studying the behavior of linearized perturbations in the quantum-corrected effective field equation at one- and two-loop order. We show that the amplitude of the quantum-corrected mode function is reduced in time, starting from its initial classical (Bunch-Davies) value. This implies that the linear perturbations do not grow; hence, the model is stable. The decrease in the amplitude is in agreement with the system developing a positive (growing) mass squared due to quantum processes. The induced mass, however, remains perturbatively small and does not go tachyonic. This ensures the stability.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological symmetry breaking, pseudo-scale invariance, dark energy and the standard model	10.1142/S0217732307023754	The energy density of the universe today may be dominated by the vacuum energy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around such a time-dependent solution breaks fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue that it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action displays a U(I) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale invariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in classical and quantum theories. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and leads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow-roll condition along with the observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar field of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(I) gauge symmetry model. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a nonzero mass for the vector field. We also show that a cosmologically broken pseudo-scale invariance can generate a wide range of masses.

Yang-Mills condensate dark energy coupled with matter and radiation	10.1088/0264-9381/24/13/011	The coincidence problem is studied for the dark energy model of effective Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) in a flat expanding universe during the matter dominated stage. The YMC energy rho(y)(t) is taken to represent the dark energy, which is coupled either with the matter rho(m)(t), or with both the matter and the radiation components rho(r) (t). The effective YM Lagrangian is completely determined by the quantum field theory up to 1-loop order with an energy scale similar to 10(-3) eV as a model parameter, and for each coupling, there is an extra model parameter. We have studied extensively the coupling models: the YMC decaying into the matter and the radiation; or vice versa the matter and radiation decaying into the YMC. It is found that, starting from the equality of radiation-matter rho(mi) = rho(ri), for a wide range of initial conditions of rho(yi) = (10(-10), 10(-2))rho(mi), the models have a scaling solution during the early stages, and the YMC levels off and becomes dominant at late time, and the present state with Omega(y) similar or equal to 0.7, Omega(m) similar or equal to 0.3 and Omega(r) similar or equal to 10(-5) is always achieved. If the YMC decays into a component, then this component also levels off later and approaches a constant value asymptotically, and the equation of state (EoS) of the YMC w(y) = rho(y)/p(y) crosses over -1 and takes the value w(y) similar or equal to -1.1 at z = 0. If the matter and radiation decay into the YMC, then rho(m)(t) proportional to a(t)(-3) and rho(r) (t) proportional to a(t)(-4) approximately for all the time, and wy approaches -1 but does not cross over-1. We have also demonstrated that, at t -> infinity, the coupled dynamics for (rho(y) (t), rho(m)(t), rho(r) (t)) is a stable attractor. Therefore, under generic circumstances, the existence of the scaling solution during the early stages and the subsequential exit from the scaling regime around z similar or equal to ( 0.3-0.5) are inevitable. Thus the coincidence problem can be naturally solved in the YMC dark energy models.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Marc Lachieze-Rey: The cosmologie constant		The cosmological constant was first introduced by Einstein, in 1917, in his general relativity theory. Since, its history has been quite complicated. The present cosmological observations seem to confirm perfectly its existence, and give access to its value. Nevertheless, this is not universally accepted : is it a fundamental constant of physics, like the other ones I will give some arguments favoring a positive answer. This constant may be interpreted as a second fundamental length in nature, at the very large scales (in addition to the Planck length, at very small scales) : the curvature radius of the vacuum. I will briefly mention how the rejection of the cosmological constant may lead to the idea of exotic matter, also called dark energy.	PENSEE
Cosmological constant problems and the renormalization group	10.1088/1751-8113/40/25/S03	The cosmological constant problem emerges when quantum field theory is applied to the gravitational theory, due to the enormous magnitude of the induced energy of the vacuum. The unique known solution of this problem involves an extremely precise fine tuning of the vacuum counterpart. We review a few of the existing approaches to this problem based on the account of the quantum ( loop) effects and pay special attention to those involving the renormalization group.

Vacuum energy and renormalization on the edge	10.1088/1751-8113/40/25/S21	The vacuum dependence on boundary conditions in quantum field theories is analysed from a very general viewpoint. From this perspective, the renormalization prescriptions not only imply the renormalization of the couplings of the theory in the bulk but also the appearance of a flow in the space of boundary conditions. For regular boundaries, this flow has a large variety of fixed points and no cyclic orbit. The family of fixed points includes Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. In one-dimensional field theories, pseudo-periodic and quasi-periodic boundary conditions are also RG fixed points. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories are conformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditions are infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundary conditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumes, we analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of the renormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energy evolution. In contrast, the renormalization group flow on the boundary does not affect the leading behaviour of the entanglement entropy of the vacuum in one-dimensional conformally invariant bosonic theories.

Cosmologies with variable parameters and dynamical cosmon: implications on the cosmic coincidence problem	10.1088/1751-8113/40/25/S23	Dynamical dark energy (DE) has been proposed to explain various aspects of the cosmological constant (CC) problem(s). For example, it is very difficult to accept that a strictly constant Lambda-term constitutes the ultimate explanation for the DE in our Universe. It is also hard to acquiesce in the idea that we accidentally happen to live in an epoch where the CC contributes an energy density value. rho(Lambda) = Lambda/8 pi G right in the ballpark of the rapidly diluting matter density rho(m) similar to 1/a(3). It should perhaps be more plausible to conceive that the vacuum energy, rho(Lambda), is actually a dynamical quantity as the Universe itself. More generally, we could even entertain the possibility that the total DE is in fact a mixture of rho(Lambda) and other dynamical components (e.g. fields, higher order terms in the effective action etc) which can be represented collectively by an effective entity X (dubbed the cosmon'). The `cosmon', therefore, acts as a dynamical DE component different from the vacuum energy. While it can actually behave phantom-like by itself, the overall DE fluid may effectively appear as standard quintessence, or even mimic at present an almost exact CC behaviour. Thanks to the versatility of such cosmic fluid we can show that a composite DE system of this sort ('Lambda CDM') may have a key to resolving the mysterious coincidence problem.

Dark energy and the false vacuum	10.1088/1751-8113/40/25/S32	In this paper, I will present highlights of a recent model of dark energy and dark matter in which the present universe is `trapped' in a false vacuum described by the potential of an axion-like scalar field (the acceleron) which is related to a new strong interaction gauge sector, SU(2)(Z), characterized by a scale Lambda(Z) similar to 3 x 10(-3) eV. This false vacuum model mimicks the Lambda CDM scenario. In addition, there are several additional implications such as a new mechanism for leptogenesis coming from the decay of a `messenger' scalar field, as well as a new model of `low- scale' inflation whose inflaton is the `radial' partner of the acceleron.

A model of electroweak-scale right-handed neutrino mass	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.03.067	If neutrino masses are realized through the see-saw mechanism, can the right-handed neutrinos be produced and detected at present and future colliders? The answer is negative in the most popular see-saw scenarios for the simple reason that they are too heavy in these models. However, a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) particle content, including mirror fermions, two SU(2)(L) triplet and one singlet Higgs fields, leads to a scenario in which the see-saw mechanism is realized with the Majorana mass M-R of the right-handed neutrino being of the order of the electroweak scale or smaller. A custodial SU(2) symmetry arising from the two triplet Higgs fields ensures that p = 1 at tree level even when their vacuum expectation values (VEV) which determine the value of M-R, can be as large as the electroweak scale. MR is found to obey the bound M-z/2 z <= M-R < 346 GeV which makes it accessible experimentally (Tevatron, LHC or ILC) since, in our scenario, v(R)'s can couple directly to the Standard Model (SM) gauge bosons.

The very local Hubble flow: simulating the transition from chaos to order	10.1051/0004-6361:20053458	The physical nature of the very local (< 3 Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the basis of the recent high-precision observations in the Local Volume. A model including both analytical treatment and computer simulations describes the flow's dynamical evolution from a chaotic Little Bang initial state to the present-day state of a quasi-regular expansion. The dynamical effect of the uniform cosmic vacuum ( time-independent dark energy or the cosmological constant) is taken into account.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Dark energy fluid with time-dependent, inhomogeneous equation of state	10.1140/epjc/s10052-007-0278-7	The four-dimensional flat Friedman universe filled with an ideal fluid with a linear (oscillating) inhomogeneous equation of state (EoS) depending on time is studied. The equations of motion are solved. It is shown that in some cases there appears a quasi-periodical universe that repeats the cycles of phantom-type space acceleration. The appearance of future singularities resulting from various choices for the input parameters is discussed.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Zeropoint fluctuations and dark energy in Josephson junctions	10.1142/S021947750700374X	We discuss the possibility that vacuum fluctuations underlying dark energy could lead to measurable effects for the quantum noise spectrum in Josephson junctions [C. Beck, M. C. Mackey, Phys. Lett. B 605, 295 (2005)]. We argue that a recent discussion of Jetzer and Straumann [Phys. Lett. B 606, 77 (2005)] relating the measured noise spectrum in Josephson junctions to van der Waals forces is incorrect. The measured noise spectrum in Josephson junctions is a consequence of the fluctuation dissipation theorem and the Josephson effect and has nothing to do with van der Waals forces. Consequently, the argument of Jetzer and Straumann does not shed any light on whether dark energy can or cannot be measured using superconducting Josephson devices. We also point out that a more recent paper of Jetzer and Straumann [Phys. Lett. B 639, 57 (2006)] claiming that `zeropoint energies do not not show up in any application of the fluctuation dissipation theorem' violates the standard view on the subject.

Strange stars and the cosmological constant problem	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/06/006	The cosmological constant problem represents an evident tension between our present description of gravity and particle physics. Many solutions have been proposed, but experimental tests are always difficult or impossible to perform and the present phenomenological investigations focus only on possible relations with the dark energy, that is with the accelerating expansion rate of the contemporary universe. Here I suggest that strange stars, if they exist, could represent an interesting laboratory to investigate this puzzle, since their equilibrium configuration is partially determined by the QCD vacuum energy density.

Wolfgang Priester: from the big bounce to the Lambda-dominated universe	10.1007/s00114-006-0187-x	Wolfgang Priester (1924-2005) was one of Germany's most versatile and quixotic astrophysicists, reinventing himself successively as a radio astronomer, space physicist and cosmologist, and making a lasting impact on each field. We focus in this personal account on his contributions to cosmology, where he will be most remembered for his association with quasars, his promotion of the idea of a nonsingular ``big bounce{''} at the beginning of the current expansionary phase, and his recognition of the importance of dark energy (Einstein's cosmological constant Lambda) well before this became the standard paradigm in cosmology.

Measurability of vacuum fluctuations and dark energy	10.1016/j.physa.2006.12.019	Vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce current fluctuations in resistively shunted Josephson junctions that are measurable in terms of a physically relevant power spectrum. In this paper we investigate under which conditions vacuum fluctuations can be gravitationally active, thus contributing to the dark energy density of the universe. Our central hypothesis is that vacuum fluctuations are gravitationally active if and only if they are measurable in terms of a physical power spectrum in a suitable macroscopic or mesoscopic detector. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed dark energy density in the universe and offers a resolution of the cosmological constant problem. Using this hypothesis we show that the observable vacuum energy density rho(vac) in the universe is related to the largest possible critical temperature T-c of superconductors through rho(vac) = sigma . (kT(c))(4)/h(3)c(3), where sigma is a small constant of the order 10(-3). This relation can be reearded as an analog of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for dark energy. Our hypothesis is testable in Josephson junctions where we predict there should be a cutoff in the measured spectrum at 1.7THz if the hypothesis is true. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermodynamical properties of dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.123516	We have investigated the thermodynamical properties of dark energy. Assuming that the dark energy temperature T similar to a(-n) and considering that the volume of the Universe enveloped by the apparent horizon relates to the temperature, we have derived the dark energy entropy. For dark energy with constant equation of state w >-1 and the generalized Chaplygin gas, the derived entropy can be positive and satisfy the entropy bound. The total entropy, including those of dark energy, the thermal radiation, and the apparent horizon, satisfies the generalized second law of thermodynamics. However, for the phantom with constant equation of state, the positivity of entropy, the entropy bound, and the generalized second law cannot be satisfied simultaneously.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Renormalization-group running cosmologies and the generalized second law	10.1016/j.physletb.2007.03.037	We explore some thermodynamical consequences of accelerated universes driven by a running cosmological constant (CC) from the renormalization group (RG). Application of the generalized second law (GSL) of gravitational thermodynamics to a framework where the running of the CC goes at the expense of energy transfer between vacuum and matter, strongly restricts the mass spectrum of a (hypothetical) theory controlling the CC running. We find that quantum effects driving the running of the CC should be dominated by a trans-Planckian mass field, in marked contrast with the GUT-scale upper mass bound obtained by analyzing density perturbations for the running CC. The model shows compliance with the holographic principle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Ionic binding in a susy background	10.1142/S0217751X07036518	From string theory and the observation of a positive vacuum energy in our universe it seems inevitable that there will eventually be a phase transition to an exactly supersymmetric (susy) universe. In this phase there will be an effective weakening of the Pauliprinciple due to Fermi-Bose degeneracy. As a consequence molecular binding will be significantly affected. We make some general comments on susy molecules and perform a variational principle estimate of ionic binding energies.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Consequences of a cosmological phase transition at the TeV scale	10.1007/s10701-007-9115-y	A finite vacuum energy density implies the existence of a UV scale for gravitational modes. This gives a phenomenological scale to the dynamical equations governing the cosmological expansion that must satisfy constraints consistent with quantum measurability and spatial flatness. Examination of these constraints for the observed dark energy density establishes a time interval from the transition to the present, suggesting major modifications from the thermal equations of state far from Planck density scales. The assumption that a phase transition initiates the radiation dominated epoch is shown under several scenarios to be able to produce fluctuations to the CMB of the order observed. Quantum measurability constraints (eg. uncertainly relations) define cosmological scales bounded by luminal expansion rates. It is shown that the dark energy can consistently be interpreted as being due to the vacuum energy of collective gravitational modes which manifest as the zero-point motions of coherent Planck scale mass units prior to the UV scale onset of gravitational quantum de-coherence for the cosmology.

Detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and corresponding dark energy constraints made with directional spherical wavelets	10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11505.x	Using a directional spherical wavelet analysis we detect the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, indicated by a positive correlation between the first-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) data. Detections are made using both a directional extension of the spherical Mexican hat wavelet and the spherical butterfly wavelet. We examine the possibility of foreground contamination and systematics in the WMAP data and conclude that these factors are not responsible for the signal that we detect. The wavelet analysis inherently enables us to localize on the sky those regions that contribute most strongly to the correlation. On removing these localized regions the correlation that we detect is reduced in significance, as expected, but it is not eliminated, suggesting that these regions are not the sole source of correlation between the data. This finding is consistent with predictions made using the ISW effect, where one would expect weak correlations over the entire sky. In a flat universe the detection of the ISW effect provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. We use our detection to constrain dark energy parameters by deriving a theoretical prediction for the directional wavelet covariance statistic for a given cosmological model. Comparing these predictions with the data we place constraints on the equation-of-state parameter w and the vacuum energy density Omega(Lambda). We also consider the case of a pure cosmological constant, that is, w= -1. For this case we rule out a zero cosmological constant at greater than the 99.9 per cent significance level. All parameter estimates that we obtain are consistent with the standard cosmological concordance model values. Although wavelets perform very well when attempting to detect the ISW effect since one may probe only the regions where the signal is present, once all information is incorporated when computing parameter estimates, the performance of the wavelet analysis is comparable to other methods, as expected for a linear approach.

The conformal status of omega=-3/2 Brans-Dicke cosmology	10.1002/andp.200610230	Following recent fit of supernovae data to Brans-Dicke theory which favours the model with omega = -3/2 [ I] we discuss the status of this special case of Brans-Dicke cosmology in both isotropic and anisotropic framework. It emerges that the limit omega = -3/2 is consistent only with the vacuum field equations and it makes such a Brans-Dicke theory conformally invariant. Then it is an example of the conformal relativity theory which allows the invariance with respect to conformal transformations of the metric. Besides, Brans-Dicke theory with omega = -3/2 gives a border between a standard scalar field model and a ghost/phantom model. In this paper we show that in omega = -3/2 Brans-Dicke theory, i.e., in the conformal relativity there are no isotropic Friedmann solutions of non-zero spatial curvature except for k = -1 case. Further we show that this k = -1 case, after the conformal transformation into the Einstein frame, is just the Milne universe and, as such, it is equivalent to Minkowski spacetime. It generally means that only flat models are fully consistent with the field equations. On the other hand, it is shown explicitly that the anisotropic non-zero spatial curvature models of Kantowski-Sachs type are admissible in omega = -3/2 Brans-Dicke theory. It then seems that an additional scale factor which appears in anisotropic models gives an extra deegre of freedom and makes it less restrictive than in an isotropic Friedmann case.

Non-local SFT tachyon and cosmology		Cosmological scenarios built upon the generalized non-local String Field Theory and p-adic tachyons are examined. A general kinetic operator involving an infinite number of derivatives is studied as well as arbitrary parameter p. The late time dynamics of just the tachyon around the non-perturbative vacuum is shown to leave the cosmology trivial. A late time behavior of the tachyon and the scale factor of the FRW metric in the presence of the cosmological constant or a perfect fluid with w > -1 is constructed explicitly and a possibility of non-vanishing oscillations of the total effective state parameter around the phantom divide is proven.

Dark energy and the MSSM	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.083507	We consider the coupling of quintessence to observable matter in supergravity and study the dynamics of both supersymmetry breaking and quintessence in this context. We investigate how the quintessence potential is modified by supersymmetry breaking and analyze the structure of the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms. We pay attention to their dependence on the quintessence field and to the electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e. the pattern of fermion masses at low energy within the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) coupled to quintessence. In particular, we compute explicitly how the fermion masses generated through the Higgs mechanism depend on the quintessence field for a general model of quintessence. Fifth force and equivalence principle violations are potentially present as the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs bosons become quintessence field dependent. We emphasize that equivalence principle violations are a generic consequence of the fact that, in the MSSM, the fermions couple differently to the two Higgs doublets. Finally, we also discuss how the scaling of the cold dark and baryonic matter energy density is modified and comment on the possible variation of the gauge coupling constants, among which is the fine structure constant, and of the proton-electron mass ratio.

Causality and superluminal behavior in classical field theories: Applications to k-essence theories and modified-Newtonian-dynamics-like theories of gravity	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.085013	Field theories with Lorentz (or diffeomorphism invariant) action can exhibit superluminal behavior through the breaking of local Lorentz invariance. Quantum induced superluminal velocities are well-known examples of this effect. The issue of the causal behavior of such propagation is somewhat controversial in the literature and we intend to clarify it. We provide a careful analysis of the meaning of causality in classical relativistic field theories and stress the role played by the Cauchy problem and the notion of chronology. We show that, in general, superluminal behavior threatens causality only if one assumes that a prior chronology in spacetime exists. In the case where superluminal propagation occurs, however, there are at least two nonconformally related metrics in spacetime and thus two available notions of chronology. These two chronologies are on equal footing, and it would thus be misleading to choose ab initio one of them to define causality. Rather, we provide a formulation of causality in which no prior chronology is assumed. We argue that this is the only way to deal with the issue of causality in the case where some degrees of freedom propagate faster than others. In that framework, then, it is shown that superluminal propagation is not necessarily noncausal, the final answer depending on the existence of an initial data formulation. This also depends on global properties of spacetime that we discuss in detail. As an illustration of these conceptual issues, we consider two field theories, namely, k-essence scalar fields and bimetric theories of gravity, and we derive the conditions imposed by causality. We discuss various applications such as the dark energy problem, modified-Newtonian-dynamics-like theories of gravity, and varying speed of light theories.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Fine-tuning free paradigm of two-measures theory: k-essence, absence of initial singularity of the curvature, and inflation with graceful exit to the zero cosmological constant state	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.083505	The dilaton-gravity sector of the two-measures field theory (TMT) is explored in detail in the context of spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology. The model possesses scale invariance which is spontaneously broken due to the intrinsic features of the TMT dynamics. The dilaton phi dependence of the effective Lagrangian appears only as a result of the spontaneous breakdown of the scale invariance. If no fine-tuning is made, the effective phi-Lagrangian p(phi,X) depends quadratically upon the kinetic term X. Hence TMT represents an explicit example of the effective k-essence resulting from first principles without any exotic term in the underlying action intended for obtaining this result. Depending of the choice of regions in the parameter space (but without fine-tuning), TMT exhibits different possible outputs for cosmological dynamics: (a) Absence of initial singularity of the curvature while its time derivative is singular. This is a sort of sudden singularities studied by Barrow on purely kinematic grounds. (b) Power law inflation in the subsequent stage of evolution. Depending on the region in the parameter space the inflation ends with a graceful exit either into the state with zero cosmological constant (CC) or into the state driven by both a small CC and the field phi with a quintessencelike potential. (c) Possibility of resolution of the old CC problem. From the point of view of TMT, it becomes clear why the old CC problem cannot be solved (without fine-tuning) in conventional field theories. (d) TMT enables two ways for achieving small CC without fine-tuning of dimensionful parameters: either by a seesaw type mechanism or due to a correspondence principle between TMT and conventional field theories (i.e. theories with only the measure of integration root(-)g in the action). (e) There is a wide range of the parameters such that in the late time universe: the equation of state w = p/rho < -1; w asymptotically (as t -> infinity) approaches -1 from below; rho approaches a constant, the smallness of which does not require fine-tuning of dimensionful parameters.

Vacuum energy and spectral function sum rules	10.1103/PhysRevA.75.083514	We reformulate the problem of the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergencies of the vacuum energy, particularly important at the cosmological level, in terms of a saturation of spectral function sum rules which leads to a set of conditions on the spectrum of the fundamental theory. We specialize the approach to both Minkowski and de Sitter space-times and investigate some examples.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
The cosmological constant as an eigenvalue of f(R)-gravity Hamiltonian constraint	10.1088/0264-9381/24/6/016	In the framework of ADM formalism, it is possible to find out eigenvalues of the WDW equation with the meaning of vacuum states, i.e. cosmological constants, for f(R) theories of gravity, where f(R) is a generic analytic function of the Ricci curvature scalar R. The explicit calculation is performed for a Schwarzschild metric where one-loop energy is derived by the zeta function regularization method and a renormalized running Lambda(0) constant is obtained.

Ellipticity in cosmic microwave background as a tracer of large-scale universe	10.1016/j.physleta.2006.10.103	Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-year data confirm the ellipticity of anisotropies of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, found previously for Boomerang and WMAP 1-year high sensitivity maps. The low noise level of the WMAP latter data enable also to show that, the ellipticity is a property not described by the conventional cosmological model fitting the power spectrum of CMB. As a large scale anomaly, the ellipticity characteristics are consistent with the effect of geodesics mixing occurring in hyperbolic universe. Its relation to other large scale effects, i.e. to suppressed low multipoles, as well as to dark energy if the latter is due to vacuum fluctuations, is then an arising issue. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Possible localized transport induced by a wave propagating along a vacuum-matter interface	10.1016/j.physleta.2006.10.028	Macroscopic derivation of the entrainment of matter induced by a surface elastic wave propagating along the flexible vacuum-matter interface is conducted by considering the nonlinear coupling between the interface and the rarefaction effect. The critical reflux values associated with the product of the second-order (unit) body forcing and the Reynolds number (representing the viscous dissipations) decrease as the Knudsen number (representing the rarefaction measure) increases from zero to 0.1. We obtained the matter-freezed or zero-volume-flow-rate states for specific Reynolds numbers and wave numbers which might be linked to the evolution of the Universe. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

On dark energy, Weyl's geometry, different derivations of the vacuum energy density and the pioneer anomaly	10.1007/s10701-007-9106-z	Two different derivations of the observed vacuum energy density are presented. One is based on a class of proper and novel generalizations of the (Anti) de Sitter solutions in terms of a family of radial functions R(r) that provides an explicit formula for the cosmological constant along with a natural explanation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) entanglement required to solve this problem. A nonvanishing value of the vacuum energy density of the order of 10(-123) M-Planck(4) is derived in agreement with the experimental observations. A correct lower estimate of the mass of the observable universe related to the Dirac-Eddington-Weyl's large number N = 10(80) is also obtained. The presence of the radial function R(r) is instrumental to understand why the cosmological constant is not zero and why it is so tiny. Finally, we rigorously prove why the proper use of Weyl's Geometry within the context of Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models can account for both the origins and the value of the observed vacuum energy density (dark energy). The source of dark energy is just the dilaton-like Jordan-Brans-Dicke scalar field that is required to implement Weyl invariance of the most simple of all possible actions. The full theory involving the dynamics of Weyl's gauge field A(mu) is very rich and may explain also the anomalous Pioneer acceleration and the temporal variations (over cosmological scales) of the fundamental constants resulting from the expansion of the Universe. This is consistent with Dirac's old idea of the plausible variation of the physical constants but with the advantage that it is not necessary to invoke extra dimensions.	FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS
Dark energy in hybrid inflation	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.063520	The situation that a scalar field provides the source of the accelerated expansion of the Universe while rolling down its potential is common in both the simple models of the primordial inflation and the quintessence-based dark energy models. Motivated by this point, we address the possibility of causing the current acceleration via the primordial inflation using a simple model based on hybrid inflation. We trigger the onset of the motion of the quintessence field via the waterfall field, and find that the fate of the Universe depends on the true vacuum energy determined by choosing the parameters. We also briefly discuss the variation of the equation of state and the possible implementation of our scenario in supersymmetric theories.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Averaging anisotropic cosmologies	10.1088/0264-9381/24/4/017	We examine the effects of spatial inhomogeneities on irrotational anisotropic cosmologies by looking at the average properties of anisotropic pressure-free models. Adopting the Buchert scheme, we recast the averaged scalar equations in Bianchi-type form and close the standard system by introducing a propagation formula for the average shear magnitude. We then investigate the evolution of anisotropic average vacuum models and those filled with pressureless matter. In the latter case we show that the backreaction effects can modify the familiar Kasner-like singularity and potentially remove Mixmaster-type oscillations. The presence of nonzero average shear in our equations also allows us to examine the constraints that a phase of backreaction-driven accelerated expansion might put on the anisotropy of the averaged domain. We close by assessing the status of these and other attempts to define and calculate `average' spacetime behaviour in general relativity.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Vacuum dark fluid	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.12.047	We address the question of unified description of dark ingredients in the Universe by a vacuum dark fluid with continuous density and pressures, which represents both distributed vacuum dark energy by a time evolving and spatially inhomogeneous cosmological term, and compact self-gravitating objects with de Sitter vacuum trapped inside. The existence of spherically symmetric globally neutral gravitationally bound vacuum objects without horizons (called G-lumps) asymptotically de Sitter at the center, is implied by the Einstein equations. Their masses are restricted by m < m(crit) where m(crit) = alpha m(P1)root rho(P1)/rho(0) with a coefficient alpha depending on the model. We introduce vacuum dark fluid and present the criterion of stability of G-lumps to external polar perturbations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B

B 639 (2006) 1], we study the conditions required for validity of the generalized second law in phantom-dominated universe in the presence of Schwarzschild black hold. Our study is independent of the origin of the phantom like behavior of the considered universe. We also discuss the generalized second law in the neighborhood of transition (from quintessence to phantom regime) time. We show that even for a constant equation of state parameter, the generalized second law may be satisfied provided that the temperature is not taken as de Sitter temperature. It is shown that in models with (only) a transition from quintessence to phantom regime the generalized second law does not hold in the transition epoch. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

``Expansion{''} around the vacuum: how far can we go from Delta?	10.1051/0004-6361:20065656	The cosmological constant (Lambda), i.e., the energy density stored in the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the Universe, is the simplest and the most natural possibility for describing the current cosmic acceleration.

In different parameter regimes, such a parametrization is capable of describing both quintessence-like and phantom-like dark energy, transient acceleration, and various (non) singular possibilities for the final destiny of the Universe, including singularities at finite values of the scale factor, the so-called ``Big Rip{''	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS

Density perturbations for a running cosmological constant	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/02/016	The dynamics of density and metric perturbations is investigated for the previously developed model where the decay of the vacuum energy into matter ( or vice versa) is due to the renormalization group (RG) running of the cosmological constant ( CC) term. The evolution of the CC depends on the single parameter., which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the quantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the Planck scale. The sign of. indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in the running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic regime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC term are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model under consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for nu > 0 there is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales ( large wavenumbers) as compared to the standard Lambda CDM model, whereas for nu > 0 there is an excess of power at low scales. We find that the LSS data rule out the range \textbackslash{}nu\textbackslash{} > 10(-4) while the values vertical bar\textbackslash{}nu\textbackslash{} <= 10(-6) look perfectly acceptable. For nu < 0 the excess of power at low scales grows rapidly and the bound is more severe. From the particle physics viewpoint, the values \textbackslash{}nu\textbackslash{} similar or equal to 10(-6) correspond to the `desert' in the mass spectrum above the GUT scale M-X similar to 10(16) GeV. Our results are consistent with those obtained in other dynamical models admitting an interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We find that the matter power spectrum analysis is a highly efficient method for discovering a possible scale dependence of the vacuum energy.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
f(R) actions, cosmic acceleration and local tests of gravity	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/02/022	We study spherically symmetric solutions in f(R) theories and its compatibility with local tests of gravity. We start by clarifying the range of validity of the weak field expansion and show that, for many models proposed to address the dark energy problem, this expansion breaks down in realistic situations. This invalidates the conclusions of several papers that make inappropriate use of this expansion. For the stable models that modify gravity only at small curvatures we find that when the asymptotic background curvature is large we approximately recover the solutions of Einstein gravity through the so-called Chameleon mechanism, as a result of the non-linear dynamics of the extra scalar degree of freedom contained in the metric. In these models one would observe a transition from Einstein to scalar-tensor gravity as the Universe expands and the background curvature diminishes. Assuming an adiabatic evolution we estimate the redshift at which this transition would take place for a source with given mass and radius. We also show that models of dynamical dark energy claimed to be compatible with tests of gravity because the mass of the scalar is large in vacuum (e.g. those that also include R-2 corrections in the action) are not viable.

Modified gravity with f(R)=root R-2-R-0(2)	10.1103/PhysRevD.75.044024	In this work we propose a modified gravity with the action f(R)=root R-2-R-0(2) instead of the Einstein-Hilbert action to describe the late time acceleration of the Universe. We obtain the equation of the modified gravity both in the metric and Palatini formalisms. An asymptotic solution of gravity equations corresponding to a constant Ricci scalar causes a late time acceleration of the Universe. We do a conformal transformation in the action of the modified gravity and obtain the equivalent minimally coupled scalar-tensor gravity. The equivalent Brans-Dicke gravity of this model is also studied. To examine this model with observation, the perihelion precession of the Mercury is compared with our prediction and we put an upper constraint of R-0 < H-0(2). This range for R-0 is also in agreement with the cosmological acceleration at the present time. Finally we show that this action has instability for the small perturbations of the metric in vacuum solution in which adding a quadratic term of Ricci scalar can stabilize it.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological dark energy: prospects for a dynamical theory	10.1088/1367-2630/9/1/011	We present an approach to the problem of vacuum energy in cosmology, based on dynamical screening of Lambda on the horizon scale. We review first the physical basis of vacuum energy as a phenomenon connected with macroscopic boundary conditions, and the origin of the idea of its screening by particle creation and vacuum polarization effects. We next discuss the relevance of the quantum trace anomaly to this issue. The trace anomaly implies additional terms in the low-energy effective theory of gravity, which amounts to a non-trivial modification of the classical Einstein theory, fully consistent with the Equivalence Principle. We show that the new dynamical degrees of freedom the anomaly contains provide a natural mechanism for relaxing Lambda to zero on cosmological scales. We consider possible signatures of the restoration of conformal invariance predicted by the fluctuations of these new scalar degrees of freedom on the spectrum and statistics of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), in light of the latest bounds from WMAP. Finally we assess the prospects for a new cosmological model in which the dark energy adjusts itself dynamically to the cosmological horizon boundary, and therefore remains naturally of order H-2 at all times without fine tuning.

Exact solutions of Brans-Dicke cosmology with decaying vacuum density	10.1088/0264-9381/24/2/004	We investigate cosmological solutions of Brans - Dicke theory with both the vacuum energy density and the gravitational constant decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter. A particular class of them, with a constant deceleration factor, sheds light on the cosmological constant problems, leading to a presently small vacuum term, and to a constant ratio between the vacuum and matter energy densities. By fixing the only free parameter of these solutions, we obtain cosmological parameters in accordance with observations of both the relative matter density and the universe age. In addition, we have three other solutions, with Brans - Dicke parameter omega = - 1 and negative cosmological term, two of them with a future singularity of big- rip type. Although interesting from the theoretical point of view, two of them are not in agreement with the observed universe. The third one leads, in the limit of large times, to a constant relative matter density, being also a possible solution to the cosmic coincidence problem.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Recent progress on GRB cosmology	10.1016/j.asr.2007.01.009	Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the Universe. Current observations show that their red-shifts are in the range of 0.1-6.3. Gamma-ray photons with energy from tens of keV to MeV, if produced at high redshifts, suffer from no extinction before they are detected. These properties would make GRBs become an attractive probe of the universe. Recently, measuring cosmology with GRBs has been studied widely since several intrinsic standard candle-like correlations were proposed. In this paper, we discuss these correlations simply and review constraints on cosmological parameters with GRBs. In particular, we discuss the constraints in several dark energy models by combining GRBs with supernovae Ia (SNe Ia). We see that the cosmological constraints obtained only with GRBs are larger than those obtained with SNe Ia for a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with mass density Omega(M) and vacuum energy density Omega(Lambda). Two reasons for this result are the current small sample of bursts and the lack of low-redshift events that are needed to calibrate the correlations. However, a combination of two types of explosion makes the constraints smaller. So, GRBs are complementary to other cosmological probes such as SNe Ia.

About universes with scale-related total masses and their abolition of presently outstanding cosmological problems	10.1002/asna.200610714	The most recently celebrated cosmological implications of the cosmic microwave background studies with WMAP (2006), though fascinating by themselves, do, however, create some extremely hard conceptual challenges for the present-day cosmology. These recent extremely refined WMAP observations seem to reflect a universe which was extremely homogeneous at the recombination age and thus is obviously causally closed at the time of the cosmic recombination era. From the very tiny fluctuations apparent at this early epoch the presently observable nonlinear cosmic density structures can, however, only have grown up, if in addition to a mysteriously high percentage of dark matter an even higher percentage of dark energy is admitted as drivers of the cosmic evolution. The required dark energy density, on the other hand, is nevertheless 120 orders of magnitude smaller then the theoretically calculated value. These are outstanding problems of present day cosmology onto which we are looking here under new auspices. We shall investigate in the following, up to what degree a universe simply abolishes all these outstanding problems in case it reveals itself as an universe of constant total energy. As we shall show basic questions like: How could the gigantic mass of the universe of about 10(80) proton masses at all become created? - Why is the presently recognized and obviously indispensable cosmic vacuum energy density so terribly much smaller than is expected from quantum theoretical considerations, but nevertheless terribly important for the cosmic evolution? - Why is the universe within its world horizon a causally closed system? -, can perhaps simply be answered, when the assumption is made that the universe has a constant total energy with the consequence that the total mass density of the universe (matter and vacuum) scales with R-u(-2). Such a scaling of matter and vacuum energy abolishes the horizon problem, and the cosmic vacuum energy density can easily be reconciled with its theoretical expectation values. In this model the mass of the universe increases linearly with the world extension R-u and can grow up from a Planck mass as a vacuum fluctuation. (c) 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Weinheim.

What if the dark energy is from the end of inflation?		Here, we explore the possible consequences if the observed dark energy is simply the cosmological constant. As inflationary theory implies a coherent vacuum within a finite `patch', we propose to treat it as a quantum object of finite size. Now, the natural transition of the vacuum at the end of inflation is to its ground state, the energy of which is constrained by the Uncertainty Principle. Identifying it with the observed dark energy gives an estimate of the size of this patch as similar to 10(-2) cm. Basically, the same result follows from a dimensional analysis and shows that there is, at least, a large quantum coherence length of similar to 10(-2) cm at the end of inflation, itself supporting the basic idea of inflation. Possible extensions to this very simple picture are discussed.	COSMIC FRONTIERS
Determination of the UV cut-off from the observed value of the Universe acceleration	10.1088/1475-7516/2007/01/028	It is shown that use of the equation of motion of the Universe scale factor allows calculation of the contribution of the vacuum influctuations to the acceleration of the Universe expansion. Renormalization of the equation is needed only in the case of massive particles. Under a known number of the different kinds of fundamental fields, this provides the determination of momentum of the ultraviolet cut-off from the observed value of acceleration.

Vacuum effective action: Semiclassical approach	10.1088/1742-6596/87/1/012014	We present a brief review of quantum corrections to the action of gravity. The main attention is concentrated on the quantum theory of matter fields (QFT) on classical metric background. The list of most interesting possible applications of quantum corrections includes inflation and the Dark Energy problem. We show that both problems can be, in principle, resolved within the semiclassical theory, without invoking quantum gravity or string theory.	PARTICLES AND FIELDS: CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM

The present Universe could be trapped in one of these degenerate vacua. With the natural requirement that the size of the extra dimension could be of the GUT scale or smaller, the energy density difference between the degenerate vacua and the true ground state can provide us with just the right amount of dark energy to account for the observed expansion rate of our Universe.

Phase transition to exact susy		The anthropic principle is based on the observation that, within narrow bounds, the laws of physics are such as to have allowed the evolution of life. The string theoretic approach to understanding this observation is based on the expectation that the effective potential has an enormous number of local minima with different particle masses and perhaps totally different fundamental couplings and space time topology. The vast majority of these alternative universes are totally inhospitable to life, having, for example, vacuum energies near the natural (Planck) scale. The statistics, however, are assumed to be such that a few of these local minima (and not more) have a low enough vacuum energy and suitable other properties to support life. In the inflationary era, the ``multiverse{''} made successive transitions between the available minima until arriving at our current state of low vacuum energy. String theory, however, also suggests that the absolute minimum of the effective potential is exactly supersymmetric. Questions then arise as to why the inflationary era did not end by a transition to one of these, when will the universe make the phase transition to the exactly supersymmetric ground state, and what will be the properties of this final state.

THEORETICAL HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Leptogenesis, dark energy, dark matter and the neutrinos		In this review we discuss how the models of neutrino masses can accommodate solutions to the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, dark energy or cosmological constant problem and dark matter candidates. The matter-antimatter asymmetry is explained by leptogenesis, originating from the lepton number violation associated with the neutrino masses. The dark energy problem is correlated with a mass varying neutrinos, which could originate from a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. In some radiative models of neutrino masses, there exists a Higgs doublet that does not acquire any vacuum expectation value. This field could be inert and the lightest inert particle could then be a dark matter candidate. We reviewed these scenarios in connection with models of neutrino masses with right-handed neutrinos and with triplet Higgs scalars.	Theoretical High Energy Physics

The puzzle of gravitation	10.1142/S0217751X06034197	We consider a model in which the Universe has an underpinning of oscillators in the quantum vacuum (or dark energy) at the Planck scale and deduce a number of otherwise inexplicable large number relations which have been considered to be empirical accidents. The analysis shows that the gravitational energy is the residual energy of the Planck oscillators constituting the Universe at large on the one hand, and elementary particles on the other. This explains a mysterious puzzle first pointed out by Weinberg several years ago, in a formula relating the pion mass to the Hubble constant, a puzzle which has remained unexplained ever since.

Cosmology as a search for overall equilibrium	10.1134/S0021364006240015	The steps followed by Einstein when he first wrote on cosmology from the point of view of the general theory of relativity are revised. It is argued that his insightful line of thought leading to the introduction of the cosmological constant in the equations of motion has only one weakness: the constancy of the cosmological term, or what is the same, its independence of the matter content of the universe. Eliminating this feature, a simple and reasonable modification of the cosmological equations of motion is proposed. The solutions of the new cosmological equations give rise to a cosmological model that tries to approach the Einstein static solution. This model exhibits very appealing features in terms of fitting current observations.	JETP LETTERS

Some arguments are given to the calculated value of the cosmological constant (Zel'dovich's approximation). A new component of space vacuum (the gravitational vacuum condensate) is involved the production of which has fixed time in our Universe. Also the phenomenon of vacuum selforganization must be included in physical consideration of the Universe evolution.	ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
Dark energy and some alternatives: a brief overview	10.1590/S0103-97332006000700002	The high-quality cosmological data, which became available in the last decade, have thrusted upon us a rather preposterous composition for the universe which poses one of the greatest challenges theoretical physics has ever faced: the so-called dark energy. By focusing our attention on specific examples of dark energy scenarios, we discuss three different candidates for this dark component, namely, a decaying vacuum energy or time-varying cosmological constant [Lambda(t)], a rolling homogeneous quintessence field (phi), and modifications in gravity due to extra spatial dimensions. As discussed, all these candidates [along with the vacuum energy or cosmological constant (Lambda)] seem somewhat to be able to explain the current observational results, which hampers any definitive conclusion on the actual nature of the dark energy.

Vacuum energy: Myths and reality	10.1142/S0218271806009431	We discuss the main myths related to the vacuum energy and cosmological constant, such as: ``unbearable lightness of space-time{''}; the dominating contribution of zero-point energy of quantum fields to the vacuum energy; non-zero vacuum energy of the false vacuum; dependence of the vacuum energy on the overall shift of energy; the absolute value of energy only has significance for gravity; the vacuum energy depends on the vacuum content; cosmological constant changes after the phase transition; zero-point energy of the vacuum between the plates in Casimir effect must gravitate, that is why the zero-point energy in the vacuum outside the plates must also gravitate; etc. All these and some other conjectures appear to be wrong when one considers the thermodynamics of the ground state of the quantum many-body system, which mimics macroscopic thermodynamics of quantum vacuum. In particular, in spite of the ultraviolet divergence of the zero-point energy, the natural value of the vacuum energy is comparable with the observed dark energy. That is why the vacuum energy is the plausible candidate for the dark energy.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Reconstructing dark energy	10.1142/S0218271806009704	This review summarizes recent attempts to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe and to probe the nature of dark energy. Reconstruction methods can be broadly classified into parametric and non-parametric approaches. It is encouraging that, even with the limited observational data currently available, different approaches give consistent results for the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter H(z) and the effective equation of state w(z) of dark energy. Model independent reconstruction using current data allows for modest evolution of dark energy density with redshift. However, a cosmological constant (= dark energy with a constant energy density) remains an excellent fit to the data. Some pitfalls to be guarded against during cosmological reconstruction are summarized and future directions for the model independent reconstruction of dark energy are explored.

From de Sitter to de Sitter: a non-singular inflationary universe driven by vacuum	10.1142/S0218271806009510	A semi-classical analysis of vacuum energy in the expanding space-time suggests that the cosmological term decays with time, with a concomitant matter production. For early times we find, in Planck units, Lambda approximate to H(4), where H is the Hubble parameter. The corresponding cosmological solution has no initial singularity, existing since an infinite past. During an infinitely long period we have a quasi-de Sitter, inflationary universe, with H approximate to 1. However, at a given time, the expansion undertakes a phase transition, with H and Lambda decreasing to nearly zero in a few Planck times, producing a huge amount of radiation. On the other hand, the late-time scenario is similar to the standard model, with the radiation phase followed by a dust era, which tends asymptotically to a de Sitter universe, with vacuum dominating again.

Gravity's immunity from vacuum: The holographic structure of semiclassical action	10.1142/S0218271806009534	Principle of equivalence, general covariance and the demand that the variation of the action functional should be well defined lead to a generic Lagrangian for semiclassical gravity of the form L = Q(a)(bcd) R-a (bcd) with del(b) Q(a)(bcd) = 0. The expansion of Q(a)(bcd) in terms of the derivatives of the metric tensor determines the structure of the theory uniquely. The zeroth order term gives the Einstein-Hilbert action and the first-order correction is given by the Gauss-Bonnet action. Remarkably, any such Lagrangian can be decomposed into surface and bulk terms which are related holographically. The equations of motion can be obtained purely from a surface term in the gravity sector and hence gravity does not respond to the changes in the bulk vacuum energy density.

Conformal symmetry of gravity and the cosmological constant problem	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.10.009	In absence of matter Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant A can be formulated as a scale-free theory depending only on the dimensionless coupling constant G Lambda, where G is Newton constant. We derive the conformal field theory (CFT) and its improved stress-energy tensor that describe the dynamics of conformally flat perturbations of the metric. The CFT has the form of a constrained lambda phi(4) field theory. In the cosmological framework the model describes the usual Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (RW) flat universe. The conformal symmetry of the gravity sector is broken by coupling with matter. The dimensional coupling constants G and Lambda are introduced by different terms in this coupling. If the vacuum of quantum matter fields respects the symmetry of the gravity sector, the vacuum energy has to be zero and the ``physical{''} cosmological constant is generated by the coupling of gravity with matter. This could explain the tiny value of the observed energy density driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Important remarks on (anti) de Sitter spaces and the cosmological constant	10.1142/S0217732306021748	A class of proper and novel generalizations of the (anti) de Sitter solutions (parametrized by a family of radial functions R(r)) are presented that could provide a very plausible resolution of the cosmological constant problem along with a natural explanation of the ultraviolet/infrared (uv/ir) entanglement required to solve this problem. A nonvanishing value of the vacuum energy density of the order of 10(-123) M-P(4) is derived in agreement with the experimental observations. The presence of the radial function R(r) is instrumental to understand why the cosmological constant is not zero and why it is so tiny. The correct lower estimate of the mass of the observable universe related to the Dirac-Eddington's large number N = 10(80) is also obtained. Finally we present our most recent findings of how Weyl Geometry via a Brans-Dicke scalar field solves the riddle of dark energy in addition to providing another derivation of the vacuum energy density.

Dark energy from coexistence of phases	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.09.057	We suggest that the current acceleration of the universe may be explained by the vacuum energy of a hidden sector which is stuck in a state of equilibrium between phases. The phases are associated to a late-time first-order phase transition, where phase coexistence originates at a temperature T-c similar to 10(-3) eV and lasts until temperature falls below T similar to 10(-4) eV. During phase coexistence, the energy density has an effective cosmological constant component with the observed magnitude. This scenario does not require supercooling and may arise naturally in realistic models. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
The supergravity quintessence model coupled to the minimal supersymmetric standard model	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/11/008	We study the cosmological evolution of the Universe when quintessence is modelled within supergravity, supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector and we also include observable matter in a third independent sector. We find that the presence of hidden sector supersymmetry breaking leads to modi. cations of the quintessence potential. We focus on the coupling of the SUGRA quintessence model to the MSSM and investigate two possibilities. First one can preserve the form of the SUGRA potential provided that the hidden sector dynamics is tuned. The currently available limits on the violations of the equivalence principle imply a universal bound on the vacuum expectation value of the quintessence field now, kappa(1/2)Q << 1. On the other hand, the hidden sector fields may be stabilized, leading to a minimum of the quintessence potential where the quintessence field acquires a mass of the order of the gravitino mass, large enough to circumvent possible gravitational problems. However, the cosmological evolution of the quintessence field is affected by the presence of the minimum of the potential. The quintessence field settles down at the bottom of the potential very early in the history of the Universe. Both at the background and the perturbation levels, the subsequent effect of the quintessence field is indistinguishable from that of a pure cosmological constant.

Legacy data and cosmological constraints from the angular-size/redshift relation for ultracompact radio sources	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/11/002	We have re-examined an ancient VLBI survey of ultracompact radio sources at 2.29 GHz, which gave fringe amplitudes for 917 such objects with total flux density greater than or similar to 0.5 Jy. A number of cosmological investigations based upon this survey have been published in recent years. We have updated the sample with respect to both redshift and radio information, and now have full data for 613 objects, significantly larger than the number (337) used in earlier investigations. The corresponding angular-size/redshift diagram gives Omega(m) = 0.25+ 0.04/ -0.03, Omega(Lambda) = 0.97 + 0.09/ -0.13 and K = 0.22 + 0.07/ -0.10 (68\% confidence limits). From this in combination with supernova data and a simple-minded approach to CMB data based upon the angular size of the acoustic horizon, our best figures are Omega(m) = 0.304 + 0.024/ -0.023, Omega(Lambda) = 0.693 + 0.034/ -0.035 and K = -0.003 + 0.021/ -0.019. We have examined a simple model of vacuum energy, based upon a scalar potential V(phi) = omega(2)(C)phi(2) / 2, to test the possibility that the vacuum is dynamical; whereas the data favour a value omega(C) = 0, they are compatible with values in excess of the Hubble rate.

By studying the model near the transition time, in which the system crosses the omega=-1 phantom divide line, the conditions needed to overcome the coincidence problem is investigated. The phantom model, as a candidate for dark energy, is considered, and for two specific examples, the quadratic and exponential phantom potentials, it is shown that it is possible the system crosses the omega=-1 line, meanwhile the coincidence problem is alleviated, the two facts that have root in observations.

Dynamical vacuum energy, holographic quintom, and the reconstruction of scalar-field dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.74.103505	When taking the holographic principle into account, the vacuum energy will acquire dynamical property that its equation of state is evolving. The current available observational data imply that the holographic vacuum energy behaves as quintom-type dark energy. We adopt the viewpoint of that the scalar-field models of dark energy are effective theories of an underlying theory of dark energy. If we regard the scalar-field model as an effective description of such a holographic vacuum theory, we should be capable of using the scalar-field model to mimic the evolving behavior of the dynamical vacuum energy and reconstructing this scalar-field model according to the fits of the observational dataset. We find the generalized ghost condensate model is a good choice for depicting the holographic vacuum energy since it can easily realize the quintom behavior. We thus reconstruct the function h(phi) of the generalized ghost condensate model using the best-fit results of the observational data.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dynamics of quintessential inflation		In this paper, we study a realistic model of quintessential inflation with radiation and matter. By the analysis of the dynamical system and numerical work about the evolution of the equation of state and cosmic density parameter, we show that this model is a good match for the current astronomical observation. The conclusion we obtain is in favour of the model where the modular part of the complex field plays the role of the inflaton whereas the argument part is the quintessence field. Numerical calculation shows that a heteroclinic orbit ( solution of the dynamical system) is interpolated between early-time de Sitter phase ( an unstable critical point) and a late-time de Sitter attractor.

Gravitational collapse of a susy star	10.1016/j.hedp.2006.06.002	The evidence for a positive vacuum energy in our universe suggests that we might be living in a false vacuum destined to ultimately decay to a true vacuum free of dark energy. At present the simplest example of such a universe is one that is exactly supersymmetric (susy). It is expected that the nucleation rate of critically sized susy bubbles will be enhanced in regions of high density such as in degenerate stars. The consequent release of energy stored in Pauli towers provides a possible model for gamma ray bursts. Whether or not all or any of the currently observed bursts are due to this mechanism, it is important to define the signatures of this susy phase transition. After such a burst, due to the lifting of degeneracy pressure, the star would be expected to collapse into a black hole even though its mass is below the Chandrasekhar limit. Previous studies have treated the star as fully releasing its stored energy before the collapse. In this article we make an initial investigation of the effects of the collapse during the gamma ray emission. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	HIGH ENERGY DENSITY PHYSICS
Gravity: A new holographic perspective	10.1142/S0218271806009029	A general paradigm for describing classical (and semiclassical) gravity is presented. This approach brings to the center-stage a holographic relationship between the bulk and surface terms in a general class of action functionals and provides a deeper insight into several aspects of classical gravity which have no explanation in the conventional approach. After highlighting a series of unresolved issues in the conventional approach to gravity, we show that (i) principle of equivalence, (ii) general covariance and (iii) a reasonable condition on the variation of the action functional, suggest a generic Lagrangian for semiclassical gravity of the form L = Q(a)(bcd)R(bcd)(a) with del(b)Q(a)(bcd) = 0. The expansion of Q(a)(bcd) in terms of the derivatives of the metric tensor determines the structure of the theory uniquely. The zeroth order term gives the Einstein-Hilbert action and the first order correction is given by the Gauss-Bonnet action. Any such Lagrangian can be decomposed into surface and bulk terms which are related holographically. The equations of motion can be obtained purely from a surface term in the gravity sector. Hence the field equations are invariant under the transformation T-ab --> T-ab + lambda g(ab) and gravity does not respond to the changes in the bulk vacuum energy density. The cosmological constant arises as an integration constant in this approach. The implications are discussed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
f(R) gravity without a cosmological constant	10.1103/PhysRevD.74.087501	In this work we consider the possibility of describing the current evolution of the universe, without the introduction of any cosmological constant or dark energy (DE), by modifying the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action. In the context of the f(R) gravities within the metric formalism, we show that it is possible to find an action without cosmological constant which exactly reproduces the behavior of the EH action with cosmological constant. In addition the f(R) action is analytical at the origin having Minkowski and Schwarzschild solutions as vacuum solutions. The found f(R) action is highly nontrivial and must be written in terms of hypergeometric functions but, in spite of looking somewhat artificial, it shows that the cosmological constant, or more generally the DE, is not a logical necessity.

Casimir effect confronts cosmological constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.08.026	It has been speculated that the zero-point energy of the vacuum, regularized due to the existence of a suitable ultraviolet cut-off scale, could be the source of the non-vanishing cosmological constant that is driving the present acceleration of the universe. We show that the presence of such a cut-off can significantly alter the results for the Casimir force between parallel conducting plates and even lead to repulsive Casimir force when the plate separation is smaller than the cut-off scale length. Using the current experimental data we rule out the possibility that the observed cosmological constant arises from the zero-point energy which is made finite by a suitable cut-off. Any such cut-off which is consistent with the observed Casimir effect will lead to an energy density which is at least about 10(12) times larger than the observed one, if gravity couples to these modes. The implications are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Non-Friedmann cosmology for the Local Universe, significance of the universal Hubble constant, and short-distance indicators of dark energy	10.1051/0004-6361:20054668	Based on the increasing evidence of the cosmological relevance of the local Hubble flow, we consider a simple analytical cosmological model for the Local Universe. This is a non-Friedmann model with a non-uniform static space-time. The major dynamical factor controlling the local expansion is the antigravity produced by the omnipresent and permanent dark energy of the cosmic vacuum (or the cosmological constant). The antigravity dominates at larger distances than 1d-2 Mpc from the center of the Local group. The model gives a natural explanation of the two key quantitative characteristics of the local expansion flow, which are the local Hubble constant and the velocity dispersion of the flow. The observed kinematical similarity of the local and global flows of expansion is clarified by the model. We analytically demonstrate the efficiency of the vacuum cooling mechanism that allows one to see the Hubble law this close to the Local group. The ``universal Hubble constant{''} HV (approximate to 60 km s(-1) Mpc(-1)), depending only on the vacuum density, has special significance locally and globally. The model makes a number of verifiable predictions. It also unexpectedly shows that the dwarf galaxies of the local flow with the shortest distances and lowest redshifts may be the most sensitive indicators of dark energy in our neighborhood.

Modified gravity, dark energy and modified Newtonian dynamics	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/09/006	We propose a class of actions for the spacetime metric that introduce corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian depending on the logarithm of some curvature scalars. We show that for some choices of these invariants the vacuum is ghost free at the perturbative level and Newtonian gravity is modified below a characteristic acceleration scale given by a(0) = c mu, where c is the speed of light and mu is a parameter of the model that also determines the late-time Hubble constant: H-0 similar to mu. In these models, besides the massless spin two graviton, there is a scalar excitation of the spacetime metric whose mass depends on the background curvature. This dependence is such that this scalar, although almost massless in vacuum, becomes massive and effectively decouples when one gets close to any source and we recover an acceptable weak field limit at short distances. There is also a (classical) `running' of Newton's constant with the distance to the sources and gravity is easily enhanced at large distances by a large ratio. We comment on the possibility of building a model with a MOND-like Newtonian limit that could explain the rotation curves of galaxies without introducing dark matter using such actions. We also explore briefly the characteristic gravitational phenomenology that these models imply: besides a long distance modi. cation of gravity they also predict deviations from Newton's law at short distances. This short distance scale depends on the local background curvature of spacetime, and we find that for experiments on the Earth's surface it is of order similar to 0.1 mm, while this distance would be bigger in space where the local curvature is significantly lower.

Scalar-field-dominated cosmology with a transient acceleration phase	10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.081301	A new cosmological scenario driven by a slow rolling homogeneous scalar field whose exponential potential V(Phi) has a quadratic dependence on the field Phi in addition to the standard linear term is discussed. The derived equation of state for the field predicts a transient accelerating phase, in which the Universe was decelerated in the past, began to accelerate at redshift z similar to 1, is currently accelerated, but, finally, will return to a decelerating phase in the future. This overall dynamic behavior is profoundly different from the standard evolution of the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant, and may alleviate some conflicts in reconciling the idea of a dark-energy-dominated universe with observables in String or M theory. Some theoretical predictions for the present scalar field plus dark matter dominated stage are confronted with cosmological observations in order to test the viability of the scenario.

Exotic low density fermion states in the two measures field theory: Neutrino dark energy	10.1142/S0217751X06032538	There exist field theory models where the fermionic energy-momentum tenser contains a term proportional to g mu nu(psi) over bar psi which may contribute to the dark energy. We show that this new field theory effect can be achieved in the Two Measures Field Theory (TMT) in the cosmological context. TMT is an alternative gravity and matter field theory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to that of General Relativity when the energy density of the fermion matter is much larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the fifth force problem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of fermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become comparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological expansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such Cosmo-Low-Energy-Physics (CLEP) states are studied in a toy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos, and the following results are obtained: neutrino mass increases as m proportional to a(3/2) (a is the scale factor); the proportionality factor in the noncanonical contribution to the neutrino energy-momentum tenser (proportional to the metric tenser) approaches a constant as a(t) -> infinity and therefore the noncanonical contribution to the neutrino energy density dominates over the canonical one similar to m/a(3) similar to a-(3/2) at the late enough universe; hence the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w = -1, i.e. neutrinos in the CLEP regime behave as a sort of dark energy as a -> infinity; the equation-of-state for the total (scalar field+ neutrino) energy density and pressure also approaches w = -1 in the CLEP regime; besides the total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field alone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy seems to be possible. We speculate that decays of the CLEP state neutrinos may be both an origin of cosmic rays and responsible for a late super-acceleration of the universe. In this sense the CLEP states exhibit simultaneously new physics at very low densities and for very high particle masses.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Josephson junctions and dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.06.020	In a recent paper Beck and Mackey [C. Beck, M.C. Mackey, astro-ph/0603397] argue that the argument we gave in our paper [Ph. Jetzer, N. Straumann, Phys. Lett. B 606 (2005) 77, astro-ph/0414034] to disprove their claim that dark energy can be discovered in the Lab through noise measurements of Josephson junctions is incorrect. In particular, they emphasize that the measured noise spectrum in Josephson junctions is a consequence of the fluctuation dissipation theorem, while our argument was based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this note we show that the fluctuation dissipation relation does not depend upon any shift of vacuum (zero-point) energies, and therefore, as already concluded in our previous paper, dark energy has nothing to do with the proposed measurements.

Antigravitational instability of cosmic substrate in the Newtonian cosmology	10.1088/0256-307X/23/8/104	A new version of the forming Universe large-scale structures is proposed, based on the refuse of analyses of only the gravitational instability of the cosmological substrate. Vacuum, i.e. the dominant nonbaryonic matter in the Universe, creates the antigravitational instability of the baryonic cosmic substrate itself and causes the formation of galaxies.

Phantom universe from CPT symmetric QFT	10.1142/S021827180600911X	We develop a generalization of semiclassical field theory for the case of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with CPT symmetry and construct a classical cosmological, scalar-field based model describing a smooth transition from ordinary dark energy to the phantom one. Our model arises from a Lagrangian with a complex potential leading to a non-trivial vacuum with real vacuum energy. Equivalence with models involving two scalar fields one of which is phantom-like is discussed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
What measurable zero point fluctuations can(not) tell us about dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/08/010	We show that laboratory experiments cannot measure the absolute value of dark energy. All known experiments rely on electromagnetic interactions. They are thus insensitive to particles and fields that interact only weakly with ordinary matter. In addition, Josephson junction experiments only measure differences in vacuum energy similar to Casimir force measurements. Gravity, however, couples to the absolute value. Finally we note that Casimir force measurements have tested zero point fluctuations up to energies of similar to 10 eV, well above the dark energy scale of similar to 0.01 eV. Hence, the proposed cut-off in the fluctuation spectrum is ruled out experimentally.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Can brane dark energy model be probed observationally by distant supernovae?	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.05.072	The recent astronomical measurements of distant supernovae as well as other observations indicate that our Universe is presently accelerating. There are different proposals for the explanation of this acceleration, such as the cosmological constant A, decaying vacuum energy, an evolving scalar field (quintessence), phantom energy, etc. Most of these proposals require the existence of exotic matter with negative pressure violating the strong energy condition. On the other hand, there have appeared many models which offer dramatically different mechanisms for the current acceleration, in which dark energy emerges from the gravity sector rather than from the matter sector. In this Letter, we compare the concordance ACDM model with the Sahni-Shtanov brane-world models of dark energy by using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. We show that new parameters in the brane model are not statistically significant in terms of the information criteria, although the best fit method gives an improved fit to the SNIa data, because of the additional parameters. This is because the information criteria of model selection compensate for this advantage by penalizing models having more free parameters. We conclude that only new future observational data are accurate enough to give an advanta-e to dark-energy models of the brane origin, i.e., a very high-significance detection is required to justify the presence of new parameters. In our statistical analysis both Riess et al.'s and Astier et al.'s SNIa samples are used. For stringent constraining parameters of the models the baryon oscillation peak (BOP) test is used.

A model of dark energy and dark matter	10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2006.04.021	A dynamical model for the dark energy is presented in which the ``quintessence{''} field is the axion, a(Z), of a spontaneously broken global U(1)(A)((Z)) symmetry whose potential is induced by the instantons of a new gauge group SU(2)(Z). The SU(2)(Z) coupling becomes large at a scale Lambda(Z) similar to 10(-3) eV starting from an initial value M at high energy which is of the order of the Standard Model (SM) couplings at the same scale M. A perspective on a possible unification of SU(2)Z with the SM will be briefly discussed. We present a scenario in which a(Z) is trapped in a false vacuum characterized by an energy density similar to(10(-3) eV)(4). The lifetime of this false vacuum is estimated to be extremely large. Other estimates relevant to the ``coincidence issue{''} include the ages of the universe when the a(Z) potential became effective, when the acceleration ``began{''} and when the energy density of the false vacuum became comparable to that of (baryonic and non-baryonic) matter. Other cosmological consequences include a possible candidate for the weakly interacting (WIMP) Cold Dark Matter as well as a scenario for leptogenesis. A brief discussion on possible laboratory detections of some of the particles contained in the model will also be presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.	NUCLEAR PHYSICS B
Dynamical relaxation of dark energy: A solution to early inflation, late-time acceleration and the cosmological constant problem	10.1016/j.physietb.2006.05.050	In recent years different explanations are provided for both an inflation and a recent acceleration in the expansion of the universe. In this Letter we show that a model of physical interest is the modification of general relativity with a Gauss-Bonnet term coupled to a dynamical scalar-field as predicted by certain versions of string theory. This construction provides a model of evolving dark energy that naturally explains a dynamical relaxation of the vacuum energy (gravitationally repulsive pressure) to a small value (exponentially close to zero) after a sufficient Dumber of e-folds. The model also leads to a small deviation from the w = -1 prediction of non-evolving dark energy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Supernova constraints on decaying vacuum cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.74.023532	There is mounting observational evidence that the expansion of our Universe is undergoing a late-time acceleration. Among many proposals to describe this phenomenon, the cosmological constant (Lambda) seems to be the simplest and the most natural explanation. However, despite its observational successes, such a possibility exacerbates the well known Lambda problem, requiring a natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we consider a cosmological scenario driven by a varying cosmological term, in which the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, Lambda proportional to H. We show that this Lambda(t)CDM model is indistinguishable from the standard one (Lambda CDM) in that the early radiation phase is followed by a long dust-dominated era, and only recently the varying Lambda term becomes dominant, accelerating the cosmic expansion. In order to test the viability of this scenario, we have used the most recent type Ia supernova data, i.e., the High-Z SN Search Team and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) Collaboration data. In particular, for the SNLS sample we have found 0.27 <=Omega(m)<= 0.37 and 0.68 <= H(0)<= 0.72 (at 2 sigma), which is in good agreement with the currently accepted estimates for these parameters.

Non-chaotic dynamics in general-relativistic and scalar-tensor cosmology	10.1088/0264-9381/23/12/016	In the context of scalar - tensor models of dark energy and inflation, the dynamics of vacuum scalar - tensor cosmology are analysed without specifying the coupling function or the scalar field potential. A conformal transformation to the Einstein frame is used and the dynamics of general relativity with a minimally coupled scalar field are derived for a generic potential. It is shown that the dynamics are non-chaotic, thus settling an existing debate.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Cosmology, Einstein's ``Mach Principle{''} and the Higgs fields	10.1142/S0217751X06032575	According to Einstein's ``Mach Principle{''} idea, inertia and mass are the result of a dynamical effect - namely a containment-confinement due to a universal energy to energy interaction, dominated by the contribution of the most distant sources in the universe, e.g. if the force weakens with distance like 1/r(n), n < 2. In the present treatment of high energy (particle) physics, quarks and leptons acquire their mass by interacting with ``Higgs{''} fields related to symmetry breakdowns. Assuming that these mass-endowing fields in fact collect and channel the cosmical contributions we find that their basic action is repulsive, so that the universal expansion is the recoil of the mass-making.

On a gravitational cutoff for the vacuum energy	10.1590/S0103-97332006000400016	A possible connection between the energy W of the vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields and gravity in ``empty space{''} is conjectured in this paper using a natural cutoff of high momenta with the help of the gravitational radius of the vacuum region considered. We found that below some ``critical{''} length L = 1 mm the pressure a is one third of the energy density epsilon, but above 1 mm the equation of state is sigma = -epsilon as for dark energy). In the case of a massive field, W does not depend on the mass of the field for L << 1 mm but for L >> 1 mm it does not depend on h. In addition, when the Newton constant tends to zero, W becomes infinite. The energy density is also a function of the volume V of the vacuum region taken into account.	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Gravitino dark matter in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with improved constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/06/005	In the framework of the constrained MSSM we re-examine the gravitino as the lightest superpartner and a candidate for cold dark matter in the Universe. Unlike in most other recent studies, we include both a thermal contribution to its relic population from scatterings in the plasma and a nonthermal one from neutralino or stau decays after freeze-out. Relative to a previous analysis (Roszkowski et al 2005 J. High. Energy Phys. JHEP08( 2005) 080) we update, extend and considerably improve our treatment of constraints from observed light element abundances on additional energy released during BBN in association with late gravitino production. Assuming the gravitino mass m(G) in the GeV to TeV range, and for natural ranges of other supersymmetric parameters, the neutralino region is excluded, except for rather exceptional cases, while for smaller values of m(G) it becomes allowed again. The gravitino relic abundance is consistent with observational constraints on cold dark matter from BBN and CMB in some well de. ned domains of the stau region but, in most cases, only due to a dominant contribution of the thermal population. This implies, depending on m(G), a large enough reheating temperature. If m(G) > 1 GeV then T-R > 10(8) GeV, if allowed by BBN and other constraints but, for light gravitinos, if m(G) > 100 keV then T-R > 3 x 10(3) GeV. On the other hand, constraints mostly from BBN imply an upper bound T-R less than or similar to 4 x 10(9) GeV, which is marginally consistent with thermal leptogenesis. Finally, most of the preferred stau region corresponds to the physical vacuum being a false vacuum. The scenario can be partially probed at the LHC.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Entanglement system, Casimir energy and black hole	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.03.070	We investigate the connection between the entanglement system in Minkowski spacetime and the black hole using the scaling analysis. Here we show that the entanglement system satisfies the Bekenstein entropy bound. Even though the entropies of two systems are the same form, the entanglement energy is different from the black hole energy. Introducing the Casimir energy of the vacuum energy fluctuations rather than the entanglement energy, it shows a feature of the black hole energy. Hence the Casimir energy is more close to the black hole than the entanglement energy. Finally, we find that the entanglement system behaves like the black hole if the gravitational effects are included properly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B

Dark energy: Recent developments	10.1142/S0217732306020573	A six-parameter cosmological model, involving a vacuum energy density that is extremely tiny compared to fundamental particle physics scales, describes a large body of increasingly accurate astronomical data. In the first part of this brief review we summarize the current situation, emphasizing recent progress. An almost infinitesimal vacuum energy is only the simplest candidate for a cosmologically significant nearly homogeneous exotic energy density with negative pressure, generically called Dark Energy. If general relativity is assumed to be also valid on cosmological scales, the existence of such a dark energy component that dominates the recent universe is now almost inevitable. We shall discuss in the second part the alternative possibility that general relativity has to be modified on distances comparable to the Hubble scale. It will turn out that observational data are further restricting theoretical speculations. Moreover, some of the recent proposals have serious defects on a fundamental level (ghosts, acausalities, superluminal fluctuations).\textbackslash{}	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Dynamical dark energy with a constant vacuum energy density	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.03.041	We present a holographic dark-energy model in which the Newton constant G(N) scales in such a way as to render the vacuum energy density a true constant. Nevertheless, the model acts as a dynamical dark-energy model since the scaling of GN goes at the expense of deviation of concentration of dark-matter particles from its canonical form and/or of promotion of their mass to a time-dependent quantity, thereby making the effective equation of state (EOS) variable and different from -1 at the present epoch. Thus the model has a potential to naturally underpin Dirac's suggestion for explaining the large-number hypothesis, which demands a dynamical GN along with the creation of matter in the universe. We show that with the aid of observational bounds on the variation of the gravitational coupling, the effective-field theory IR cutoff can be strongly restricted, being always closer to the future event horizon than to the Hubble distance. As for the observational side, the effective EOS restricted by observation can be made arbitrary close to -1, and therefore the present model can be considered as a ``minimal{''} dynamical dark-energy scenario. In addition, for nonzero but small curvature (vertical bar Omega(k0)vertical bar less than or similar to 0.003), the model easily accommodates a transition across the phantom line for redshifts z less than or similar to 0.2, as mildly favored by the data. A thermodynamic aspect of the scenario is also discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Cosmologies with energy exchange	10.1103/PhysRevD.73.103520	We provide a simple mathematical description of the exchange of energy between two fluids in an expanding Friedmann universe with zero spatial curvature. The evolution can be reduced to a single nonlinear differential equation which we solve in physically relevant cases and provide an analysis of all the possible evolutions. Particular power-law solutions exist for the expansion scale factor and are attractors at late times under particular conditions. We show how a number of problems studied in the literature, such as cosmological vacuum-energy decay, particle annihilation, and the evolution of a population of evaporating black holes, correspond to simple particular cases of our model. In all cases we can determine the effects of the energy transfer on the expansion scale factor. We also consider the situation in the presence of ``antidecaying{''} fluids and so-called ``phantom{''} fluids which violate the dominant energy conditions.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Gauge-noninvariance of quantum cosmology and vacuum dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.02.060	We address the question how to adapt cosmological constant Lambda for description of a vacuum dark energy density jumping from the big initial value to the small today value suggested by observations. We find such a possibility in the gauge-noninvariance of quantum cosmology which leads to a connection between a choice of the gauge and quantum spectrum for a certain physical quantity which can be specified in the framework of the minisuperspace model. We introduce a particular gauge in which the cosmological constant Lambda is quantized and show that making a measurement of Lambda today one can find its small value with the biggest probability, while at the beginning of the evolution, the biggest probability corresponds to its biggest value. Transitions between quantum levels of Lambda in the course of the Universe evolution, could be related to several scales for symmetry breaking. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wiggly cosmic strings accrete dark energy	10.1142/S0218271806008322	This paper deals with a study of the cylindrically symmetric accretion of dark energy with equation of state p = w rho onto wiggly straight cosmic strings, interpreting that the accreted energy only contributes the extent of the wiggliness, but consistently leaves invariant the unperturbed line density mu(o). We have obtained that when w > -1, the perturbed linear energy density in the string core gradually increases tending to a finite maximum value as time increases, for all considered dark energy models. Where the dominant energy condition is violated, all such models predict a steady decreasing of the perturbed linear energy density mu of the cosmic strings as phantom energy is being accreted. The final state of the string after such an accretion process is a wiggleless defect. It is argued however, that if accreation of phantom energy would proceed by successive quantum steps, then the defect would continue losing perturbed linear energy density beyond mu(o), until a minimum nonzero value which can be smaller than that corresponding to the unperturbed string.

Reconstruction of five-dimensional bounce cosmological models from deceleration factor	10.1007/s10773-006-9073-8	In this paper, we consider a class of five-dimensional Ricci-flat vacuum solutions, which contain two arbitrary functions mu(t) and nu(t). It is shown that mu(t) can be rewritten as a new arbitrary function f(z) in terms of redshift z and the f(z) can be determined by choosing particular deceleration parameters q(z) which gives early deceleration and late time acceleration. In this way, the 5D cosmological model can be reconstructed and the evolution of the universe can be determined.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Physical constants and the Gurzadyan-Xue formula for the dark energy	10.1142/S0217732306020081	We consider cosmological implications of the formula for the dark energy density derived by Gurzadyan and Xue(1,2) which predicts a value fitting the observational one. Cosmological models with varying by time physical constants, namely, speed of light and gravitational constant and/or their combinations, are considered. In one of the models, for example, vacuum energy density induces effective negative curvature, while another one has an unusual asymptotic. This analysis also explicitly rises the issue of the meaning and content of physical units and constants in cosmological context.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Devaluation: a dynamical mechanism for a naturally small cosmological constant	10.1016/j.physletb.2006.01.002	We propose a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem consistent with the standard cosmology and successful over a broad range of energies. This solution is based on the existence of a new field, the devaluton, with its potential modeled on a tilted cosine. After inflation, the universe reheats and populates the devaluton's many minima. As the universe cools, domain walls form between different regions. The domain wall network then evolves and sweeps away regions of higher vacuum energy in favor of lower energy ones. Gravitation itself provides a cutoff at a minimum vacuum energy, thus leaving the universe with a small cosmological constant comparable in magnitude to the present day dark energy density.

Stable dark energy stars	10.1088/0264-9381/23/5/006	The gravastar Picture is an alternative model to the concept of a black hole, where there is an effective phase transition at or near where the event horizon is expected to form, and the interior is replaced by a de Sitter condensate. In this work a generalization of the gravastar picture is explored by considering matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state, omega equivalent to p/p < - 1/3, to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface. The motivation for implementing this generalization arises from the fact that recent observations have confirmed an accelerated cosmic expansion, for which dark energy is a possible candidate. Several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations are analysed by imposing specific choices for the mass function. The first case considered is that of a constant energy density, and the second choice that of a monotonic decreasing energy density in the star's interior. The dynamical stability of the transition layer of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is also explored. It is found that large stability regions exist that are sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form, so that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars, analysed in this work, from an astrophysical black hole.

Some studies on dark energy related problems	10.1140/epjc/s2005-02457-8	In this work we perform some studies related to dark energy. Firstly, we propose a dynamical approach to explain the dark energy contents of the universe. We assume that a massless scalar field couples to the Hubble parameter with some Planck-mass suppressed interactions. This scalar field develops a Hubble parameter-dependent (thus time-dependent) vacuum expectation value, which renders a time-independent relative density for the dark energy and thus can explain the coincidence of the dark energy density of the universe. Furthermore, we assume that the dark matter particle is metastable and decays very late into the dark energy scalar field. Such a conversion of matter to dark energy can give an explanation for the starting time of the accelerating expansion of the universe. Secondly, we introduce multiple Affleck-Dine fields to the landscape scenario of dark energy in order to have the required baryon-asymmetrical universe.	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C
Consistent long distance modification of gravity from inverse powers of the curvature	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/03/008	In this paper we study long distance modi. cations of gravity obtained by considering actions that are singular in the limit of vanishing curvature. In particular, we showed in a previous publication that models that include inverse powers of curvature invariants that diverge for r -> 0 in the Schwarzschild geometry recover an acceptable weak field limit at short distances from sources. We study then the linearization of generic actions of the form L = F[R, P, Q] where P = R mu nu R mu nu and Q = (RR mu nu lambda sigma)-R-mu nu lambda sigma. We show that for the case in which F[R, P, Q] = F[R, Q-4P], the theory is ghost free. Assuming this is the case, in the models that can explain the acceleration of the Universe without recourse to Dark Energy there is still an extra scalar field in the spectrum besides the massless spin two graviton. The mass of this extra excitation is of the order of the Hubble scale in vacuum. We nevertheless recover Einstein gravity at short distances because the mass of this scalar field depends on the background in such a way that it effectively decouples when one gets close to any source. Remarkably, for the values of the parameters necessary to explain the cosmic acceleration the induced modi. cations of gravity are suppressed at the Solar System level but can be important for systems like a galaxy.

Dynamical dark energy or variable cosmological parameters?	10.1142/S0217732306019554	One of the main aims in the next generation of precision cosmology experiments will be an accurate determination of the equation of state (EOS) for the dark energy (DE). If the latter is dynamical, the resulting barotropic index omega should exhibit a nontrivial evolution with the redshift. This is usually interpreted as a sign that the mechanism responsible for the DE is related to some dynamical scalar field, and in some cases this field may behave non-canonically (phantom field). Present observations seem to favor an evolving DE with a potential phantom phase near our time. In the literature, there is a plethora of dynamical models trying to describe this behavior. Here we show that the simplest option, namely a model with a variable cosmological term, Lambda = Lambda(t), leads in general to a nontrivial effective EOS, with index omega(e), which may naturally account for these data features. We prove that in this case there is always a ``crossing{''} of the omega(e) = -1 barrier near our time. We also show how this effect is modulated (or even completely controlled) by a variable Newton's gravitational coupling G = G(t).	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A

Dark energy and decompactification in string gas cosmology		We study the stability of extra dimensions in string gas cosmology at late times. Vacuum energy and, interestingly, baryons lead to decompactification after they become dynamically important. The string gas can stabilise the effect of baryons, but not that of vacuum energy. However, we find that the interplay of baryons and strings can lead to acceleration in the visible dimensions, without the need for vacuum energy.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Particle dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.73.043520	We explore the physics of a gas of particles interacting with a condensate that spontaneously breaks Lorentz invariance. The equation of state of this gas varies from 1/3 to less than -1 and can lead to the observed cosmic acceleration without requiring a vacuum energy. The particles are always stable. In our particular class of models these particles are fermions with a chiral coupling to the condensate. They may behave as relativistic matter at early times, produce a brief period where they dominate the expansion with w < 0 today, and behave as matter at late time. There are no small parameters in our models, which generically lead to dark energy clustering and, depending on the choice of parameters, smoothing of small scale power.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Equation of state for an interacting holographic dark energy model	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.11.043	We investigate a model of the interacting holographic dark energy with cold dark matter (CDM). If the holographic energy density decays into CDM. we find two types of the effective equation of state. In this case we have to use the effective equations of state (omega(eff)(Lambda)) instead of A the equation of state (omega(Lambda)). For a fixed ratio of two energy densities, their effective equations of state are given by the same negative constant. Actually, the cosmic antifriction arisen from the vacuum decay process may induce the acceleration with omega(eff)(Lambda) < -1/3. For a variable ratio, their effective equations of state are slightly different, but they approach the same negative constant in the far future. Consequently, we show that such an interacting holographic energy model cannot accommodate a transition from the dark energy with omega(eff)(Lambda) >= -1 to the phantom regime with omega(eff)(Lambda) < -1.

This leads to the cosmic coincidence conundrum. As the explanation for this problem we propose the FRW model with dark matter and dark energy which interact each other exchanging energy. We show that the cubic correction to the Hubble law, measured by distant supernovae type la, probes this interaction. We demonstrate that influences between nonrelativistic matter and vacuum sectors are controlled by third and higher derivatives of the scale factor. As an example we consider flat decaying Lambda(t) FRW cosmologies. We point out the possibility of measure of the energy transfer by the cubic and higher corrections to Hubble's law. The statistical analysis of SNIa data is used as an evidence of energy transfer. We find that there were the transfer from the dark energy sector to the dark matter one without any assumption about physics governing this process. We confront this hypothesis about the transfer with SNIa observations and find that the transfer the phantom and matter sector is admissible for Omega(m,0) = 0.27. We also demonstrate that it is possible to differentiate between the energy transfer model and the variable coefficient equation of state model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Was there a decelerating past for the universe?		Some analyzes of the apparent magnitude-redshift data of type Ia supernovas indicate that the suspected dark energy in the universe cannot be regarded as a cosmological constant of general relativistic origin or as the vacuum energy encountered in quantum field theories. If this is the case, our knowledge of the physical world remains deficient since no tested theory involves such a dark energy. Under this circumstance, an equation of state of the form p = w rho is not well-motivated and one is unable to use the Einstein equation in this case as well. I argue that the very method of analysing the data by assuming exotic energy densities with strange equations of state itself is misleading and the reasonable remaining option is to make a model-independent analysis of SNe data, without reference to the energy densities. In this basically kinematic approach, we limit ourselves to the observationally justifiable assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy, i.e., to the assumption that the universe has a RW metric. This cosmographic approach is historically the original one in cosmology. The analysis was performed by expanding the scale factor into a fifth-order polynomial, an assumption that can be further generalized to any order. The values obtained for the present expansion rates h, q(0), r(0) etc. are relevant, since any cosmological solution would ultimately need to explain them. Using this method, we address an important question relevant to cosmology: Was there a decelerating past for the universe? To answer this, the Bayes's probability theory is employed, which is the most appropriate tool for quantifying our knowledge when it changes through the acquisition of new data. The cosmographic approach helps to sort out models which were always accelerating from those which decelerated for at least some time in the period of interest. Bayesian model comparison technique is used to discriminate these rival hypotheses with the aid of recent releases of supernova data. It is argued that the lessons learned using Bayesian theory are extremely valuable to avoid frequent U-turns in cosmology.	1st Crisis in Cosmology Conference, CCC-I
Tommy gold revisited: Why doesn't the universe rotate?		Understanding gravitational collapse requires understanding how similar to 10(58) nucleons can be destroyed in similar to 10(-5) seconds. The recent proposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a ``dark energy star{''} implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational collapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions where classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form. The negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event horizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why gravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is that the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also be possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the ``big bang{''}. In this new cosmology the observable universe began as a fluctuation in an overall steady state universe. The fluctuations in the CMB in this picture are the result of quantum turbulence associated with vorticity. This explanation for the CMB fluctuations is superior to inflationary scenarios because there is a natural explanation for both the level of CMB fluctuations and the deviation from a scale invariant spectrum at large scales.	1ST CRISIS IN COSMOLOGY CONFERENCE, CCC-I
Dark energy: Mystery of the millennium		Nearly seventy per cent of the energy density in the universe is unclustered and exerts negative pressure. This conclusion - now supported by numerous observations - poses the greatest challenge for theoretical physics today. I discuss this issue with special emphasis on the cosmological constant as the possible choice for the dark energy. Several curious features of a universe with a cosmological constant are described and some possible approaches to understand the nature of the cosmological constant are reviewed. In particular, I show how some of the recent ideas, related to a thermodynamic route to gravity, allow us to: (i) create a paradigm in which the bulk value of cosmological constant is irrelevant and (ii) obtain the correct, observed, value for the cosmological constant from vacuum fluctuations in a region confined by the deSitter horizon.

LENR and ``cold fusion{''} excess heat: Their relation to other anomalous microphysical energy experiments and emerging new energy technologies	10.1142/9789812701510\_0091	During the past 15 years, indisputable experimental evidence has built up for substantial excess heat (far beyond ordinary chemical energy) and low-energy nuclear reaction phenomena in specialized heavy hydrogen and ordinary hydrogen-containing systems.' The primary theorists in the field that is properly designated Cold Fusion/LENR have generally assumed that the excess heat phenomena is commensurate with nuclear ash (such as helium), whether already identified or presumed to be present but not yet found. That was an excellent initial hypothesis. However, the commensurate nuclear ash hypothesis has not been proved, and appears to be approximately correct in only a few experiments. During this same period, compelling evidence although not as broadly verified as data from cold fusion/LENR has also emerged for other microphysical sources of energy that were previously unexpected by accepted physics. The exemplar of this has been the ``hydrino{''} physics work of Dr. Randall Mills and his colleagues at Black-Light Power Corporation, which was a radical outgrowth from the cold fusion field that emerged publicly in May 1991.(2) Even more far-reaching is the work in vacuum energy extraction pioneered by Dr. Paulo and Alexandra Correa, which first became public in 1996.(3) This vacuum energy experimentation began in the early 1980s and has been reduced to prototype technological devices, such as the patented PACDTM (pulsed abnormal glow discharge) electric power generator, as well as many published experiments that can be performed in table-top fashion to verify the Correa Aetherometry (non-luminiferous or non-electromagnetic aether measurement science).(4) In an era when mainstream science and its media is all agog about dark matter and dark energy composing the vast bulk of the universe, there is a great need to reconcile, if possible, the significant bodies of evidence from these three major experimental and theoretical streams: cold fusion/LENR, hydrino physics, and Aetherometry. The aim of the present paper is to compare the substantial features of each field of investigation and to suggest how to move forward for the benefit of all with openness and a minimum of preconceptions.

Dark-energy equation of state: how far can we go from Lambda?		The equation of state of dark energy is investigated to determine how much it may deviate from the equation of state of the cosmological constant (CC). Two aspects of the problem are studied: the ``expansion{''} around the vacuum equation of state and the problem of the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary.	DARK SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE
Dark energy, chaotic fields, and fundamental constants	10.1007/1-4020-4339-2\_20	To explain the currently observed accelerated expansion of the universe, a large number of different theoretical models are presently being discussed. In one way or another, all of these contain `new physics', though at different levels. The big question is how to select out of infinitely many possible models the right one. We here discuss a possibility that has so far been somewhat neglected, namely that the new physics underlying dark energy arises out of a gravitationally active amendment of the electroweak and strong sector of the standard model. This amendment basically consists of a rapidly fluctuating gravitationally active dynamics of vacuum fluctuations with a cutoff of the order of the neutrino mass scale. We consider a concrete model for this based on second-quantized self-interacting scalar fields, which evolve in a chaotic way. It is shown that expectations with respect to the chaotic dynamics yield statements on the observed numerical values of the electroweak coupling constants with amazing precision, thus providing evidence for the physical relevance of this model.

How fundamental is gravitation?	10.1007/1-4020-4339-2\_21	We consider a model in which the Universe has an underpinning of oscillators in the Quantum Vacuum (or dark energy) at the Planck scale and deduce a number of otherwise inexplicable Large Number relations which have been considered to be empirical accidents. The analysis shows that the gravitational energy is the residual energy of the Planck oscillators constituting the Universe at large on the one hand, and elementary particles on the other. This explains a mysterious puzzle first pointed out by Weinberg several years ago, in a formula relating the pion mass to the Hubble Constant, a puzzle which has remained unexplained ever since.

Schrodinger equation for joint bidirectional evolution in time		A straightforward extension of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is proposed that can describe physical systems comprising two interacting subsystems: one subsystem evolves forward in time, the other, backward. The space of quantum states is the direct sum of the states representing the respective subsystems, whereupon there are two linearly independent vacuum states, one each for the forward and the backward subspace. An indefinite metric is imposed on the space of quantum states such that purely forward (respectively, purely backward) states have positive (respectively, negative) norms. Hamiltonians are self-adjoint operators with respect to the metric, such that interactions/transitions between the subspaces can be accounted for. Given suitable definitions of input and of output states at the two ends of a time interval, input and output states separately have positive norms such that probability is conserved, and hence S-matrices are unitary. A discussion of the physics entailed in the proposed formalism is undertaken. Then as an application, a simple model of a relativistic quantum field theory is proposed. In this model, the expected vacuum energy (thought to be associated with the cosmological constant) almost vanishes uniformly for times in an interval due to cancellation of the energies of the forward and backward vacuum states; this cancellation holds whatever be the input vacuum state at the ends of the time interval. A model is advanced wherein magnetic monopoles live exclusively in backward-evolving states, and interact with forward-evolving electric charges in a certain way. Proposals for further research, particularly concerning the possible detection of advanced gravitational waves, and a conjecture on the physics of dark matter and dark energy, conclude the report.

Transition from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion in braneworld universes	10.1007/s10714-005-0209-6	Braneworld theory provides a natural setting to treat, at a classical level, the cosmological effects of vacuum energy. Non-static extra dimensions can generally lead to a variable vacuum energy, which in turn may explain the present accelerated cosmic expansion. We concentrate our attention in models where the vacuum energy decreases as an inverse power law of the scale factor. These models agree with the observed accelerating universe, while fitting simultaneously the observational data for the density and deceleration parameter. The redshift at which the vacuum energy can start to dominate depends on the mass density of ordinary matter. For (Omega) over bar (m) = 0.3, the transition from decelerated to accelerated cosmic expansion occurs at z (T) approximate to 0.48 +/- 0.20, which is compatible with SNe data. We set a lower bound on the deceleration parameter today, namely (q) over bar > - 1 + 3 (Omega) over bar (m)/2 i.e., (q) over bar -0.55 for (Omega) over bar (m) = 0.3. The future evolution of the universe crucially depends on the time when vacuum starts to dominate over ordinary matter. If it dominates only recently, at an epoch z < 0.64, then the universe is accelerating today and will continue that way forever. If vacuum dominates earlier, at z > 0.64, then the deceleration comes back and the universe recollapses at some point in the distant future. In the first case, quintessence and Cardassian expansion can be formally interpreted as the low energy limit of our model, although they are entirely different in philosophy. In the second case there is no correspondence between these models and ours.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Structure formation in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati cosmological model	10.1088/1475-7516/2006/01/016	The DGP brane-world model provides an alternative to the standard LCDM cosmology, in which the late universe accelerates due to a modi. cation of gravity rather than vacuum energy. The cosmological constant. in LCDM is replaced by a single parameter, the crossover scale r(c), in DGP. The supernova redshift observations can be fitted by both models, with Lambda similar to H-0(2) and rc similar to H-0(-1) This degeneracy is broken by structure formation, which is suppressed in di. erent ways in the two models. There is some confusion in the literature about how the standard linear growth factor is modified in the DGP model. While the luminosity distance can be computed purely from the modified four-dimensional Friedman equation, the evolution of density perturbations requires an analysis of the five-dimensional gravitational field. We show that if the five-dimensional effects are inappropriately neglected, then the four-dimensional Bianchi identities are violated and the computed growth factor is incorrect. By using the five-dimensional equations, we derive the correct growth factor.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Laboratory tests on dark energy	10.1088/1742-6596/31/1/021	The physical nature of the currently observed dark energy in the universe is completely unclear, and many different theoretical models co-exist. Nevertheless, if dark energy is produced by vacuum fluctuations then there is a chance to probe some of its properties by simple laboratory tests based on Josephson junctions. These electronic devices can be used to perform `vacuum fluctuation spectroscopy', by directly measuring a noise spectrum induced by vacuum fluctuations. One would expect to see a cutoff near 1.7 THz in the measured power spectrum, provided the new physics underlying dark energy couples to electric charge. The effect exploited by the Josephson junction is a subtile nonlinear mixing effect and has nothing to do with the Casimir effect or other effects based on van der Waals forces. A Josephson experiment of the suggested type will now be built, and we should know the result within the next 3 years.	Third 21COE Symposium: Astrophysics as Interdisciplinary Science
Einstein's universe: The challenge of dark energy		From an observational perspective, cosmology is today in excellent shape - we can now look back to when the first galaxies formed similar to 1 Gyr after the Big Bang, and reconstruct the thermal history back to the primordial nucleosynthesis era when the universe was similar to 1 s old. However recent deep studies of the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion rate is accelerating, requiring the dominant component of the universe to have negative pressure like vacuum energy. This has been indirectly substantiated through detailed studies of angular anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and of spatial correlations of the large-scale structure of galaxies, which also require most of the matter component to be non-baryonic. Although there are plausible candidates for the constituent of the dark matter in physics beyond the Standard Model (e.g. supersymmetry), the energy scale of the required `dark energy' is similar to 10(-12) GeV, well below any known scale of fundamental physics. This has refocussed attention on the notorious cosmological constant problem at the interface of general relativity and quantum field theory. It is likely that the resolution of this issue will require fundamental modifications to Einstein's ideas about gravity.	CURRENT SCIENCE
Cosmology with weak lensing surveys	10.1098/rsta.2005.1672	Weak gravitational lensing is responsible for the shearing and magnification of the images of high-redshift sources due to the presence of intervening mass. Since the lensing effects arise from deflections of the light rays due to fluctuations of the gravitational potential, they can be directly related to the underlying density field of the large-scale structures. Weak gravitational surveys are complementary to both galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background observations as they probe unbiased nonlinear matter power spectra at medium redshift. Ongoing CMBR experiments such as WMAP and a future Planck satellite mission will measure the standard cosmological parameters with unprecedented accuracy. The focus of attention will then shift to understanding the nature of dark matter and vacuum energy: several recent studies suggest that lensing is the best method for constraining the dark energy equation of state. During the next 5 year period, ongoing and future weak lensing surveys such as the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM; e.g. SNAP) or the Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope will play a major role in advancing our understanding of the universe in this direction. In this review article., we describe various aspects of probing the matter power spectrum and the bispectrum and other related statistics with weak lensing surveys. This can be used to probe the background dynamics of the universe as well as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.	"PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL

Curved space or curved vacuum?	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2005.08.004	While the simple Picture of a spatially flat, matter plus cosmological constant universe fits current observation of the accelerated expansion, strong consideration has also been given to models with dynamical Vacuum energy. We examine the tradeoff of ``curving{''} the vacuum but retaining spatial flatness, vs. curving space but retaining the cosmological constant. These different breakdowns in the simple picture could readily be distinguished by combined high accuracy supernovae and cosmic microwave background distance Measurements. If we allow the uneasy situation of both breakdowns, the curvature can still be measured to No, but at the price of degrading estimation of the equation of state time variation by 60\% or more, unless additional information (Such as weak lensing data or a tight matter density prior) is included.

A new perspective on gravity and dynamics of space-time	10.1142/S0218271805007863	The Einstein-Hilbert action has a bulk term and a surface term (which arises from integrating a four divergence). I show that one can obtain Einstein's equations from the surface term alone. This leads to: (i) a novel, completely self-contained, perspective on gravity and (ii) a concrete mathematical framework in which the description of space-time dynamics by Einstein's equations is similar to the description of a continuum solid in the thermodynamic limit.

Generalized holographic dark energy and the IR cutoff problem	10.1103/PhysRevD.72.125011	We consider a holographic dark energy model, in which both the cosmological-constant (CC) energy density rho(Lambda) and the Newton constant G(N) are varying quantities, to study the problem of setting an effective field-theory IR cutoff. Assuming that ordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation univocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either rho(Lambda) or G(N) is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy disfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially flat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is not allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the redshifts z greater than or similar to 0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for the IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the ``coincidence problem{''} usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to spatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice for the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a universe that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from deceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff consistency procedure to a renormalization-group (RG) running CC model, in which the low-energy variation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses near the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model (having the most general cosmology for running CC universes) in full accordance with holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square root of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only undetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give early deceleration as well as late-time acceleration. The possibility of further improvement of the model is also briefly indicated.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Finslerian quantum field theory	10.1016/j.na.2005.02.085	Finsler geometry suggests a generalization of the Riemannian structure of spacetime to include dependence of the spacetime metric and associated invariant tensor fields on the four-velocity coordinates as well as the spacetime coordinates of the observer. It is useful to consider the tangent bundle of spacetime with spacetime in the base manifold and four-velocity space in the fiber. A physical basis for the differential geometric structure of the spacetime tangent bundle is provided by the universal upper limit on proper acceleration relative to the vacuum. It is then natural to consider a quantum field having a vanishing eigenvalue when acted on by the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the spacetime tangent bundle. On this basis a quantum field theory can be constructed having a built-in intrinsic regularization at the Planck scale, and finite vacuum energy density. This may provide insight concerning the cosmological constant and the accelerating universe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
Cosmological dynamics of R-n gravity	10.1088/0264-9381/22/22/011	A detailed analysis of dynamics of cosmological models based on R-n gravity is presented. We show that the cosmological equations can be written as a first-order autonomous system and analysed using the standard techniques of dynamical system theory. In the absence of perfect fluid matter, we find exact solutions whose behaviour and stability are analysed in terms of the values of the parameter n. When matter is introduced, the nature of the (non-minimal) coupling between matter and higher order gravity induces restrictions on the allowed values of n. Selecting such intervals of values and following the same procedure used in the vacuum case, we present exact solutions and analyse their stability for a generic value of the parameter n. From this analysis emerges the result that for a large set of initial conditions an accelerated expansion is an attractor for the evolution of the R-n cosmology. When matter is considered a transient almost-Friedman phase can also be present before the transition to accelerated expansion.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
SnIa constraints on the event-horizon thermodynamical model of dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.09.045	We apply the thermodynamical model of the cosmological event horizon of the spatially flat FLRW metrics to the study of the recent accelerated expansion phase and to the coincidence problem. This model, called ``ehT model{''} hereafter, led to a dark energy (DE) density A varying as r(-2), where r is the proper radius of the event horizon. Recently, another model motivated by the holographic principle gave an independent justification of the same relation between A and r. We probe the theoretical results of the ehT model with respect to the SnIa observations and we compare it to the model deduced from the holographic principle, which we call ``LHG model{''} in the following. Our results are in excellent agreement with the observations for H-0 = 64 km s(-1) Mpc(-1), and Omega(Lambda)(0) = 0.63(-0.01)(+0.1), which leads to q(0) = -0.445 and z(T) similar or equal to 0.965.

The age of the universe in Cardassian models	10.1088/1475-7516/2005/10/007	The age of the universe is obtained in a subset of Cardassian models by using WMAP data. Cardassian expansion is a modi. cation to the Friedmann equation that allows the universe to be flat, matter dominated, and accelerating, without a vacuum component. Since this model changes the evolution of the universe, we should not a priori expect the Cardassian age to be the same as the WMAP Friedmann derived result of 13.7 +/- 0.2 Gyr. However, in the subset of Cardassian models that we consider, we discover that the age of the universe varies from 13.4 to 13.8 Gyr over the range of parameter space that we explore, a result close to that of the standard. cold dark matter model. The Hubble constant h, which may also vary in these models, likewise varies little from the Friedmann result.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Effective equation of state for dark energy: Mimicking quintessence and phantom energy through a variable Lambda	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.08.051	While there is mounting evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology for a non-vanishing dark energy component in the Universe, we are still far away from understanding its ultimate nature. A fundamental cosmological constant, A, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to generate an effective A have been devised which postulate the existence of a peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof). These models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive possibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state (EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology (e.g., the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of an EOS parametrized a la quintessence. Here we show that by fitting cosmological data to an EOS of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of a fundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: Lambda = Lambda (t). We exemplify this possibility by studying the effective EOS associated to a renormalization group (RG) model for Lambda. We find that the effective EOS can correspond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending on the value of a single parameter of the RG model. We conclude that behind a non-trivial EOS of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there can actually be a running cosmological term A of a fundamental quantum field theory.

Vacuum energy from an extra dimension with UV/IR connection	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.08.016	We propose a lower limit on the size of a single discrete gravitational extra dimension in the context of an effective field theory for massive gravitons. The limit arises in this setup from the requirement that the Casimir energy density of quantum fields is in agreement with the observed dark energy density of the universe rho(obs) similar or equal to 10(-47) GeV4. The Casimir energy densities can be exponentially suppressed to an almost arbitrarily small value by the masses of heavy bulk fields, thereby allowing a tiny size of the extra dimension. This suppression is only restricted by the strong coupling scale of the theory, which is known to be related to the compactification scale via an UV/IR connection for local gravitational theory spaces. We thus obtain a lower limit on the size of the discrete gravitational extra dimension in the range (10(12) GeV)(-1) ... (10(7) GeV)(-1), while the strong coupling scale is by a factor similar to 10(2) larger than the compactification scale. We also comment on a possible cancelation of the gravitational contribution to the quantum effective potential. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Cosmography, decelerating past, and cosmological models: Learning the Bayesian way	10.1086/432111	In this paper, using a significantly improved version of the model- independent, cosmographic approach to cosmology, we address an important question: was there a decelerating past for the universe? To answer this, Bayes's probability theory is employed, which is the most appropriate tool for quantifying our knowledge when it changes through the acquisition of new data. The cosmographic approach helps to sort out the models in which the universe was always accelerating from those in which it decelerated for at least some time in the period of interest. The Bayesian model comparison technique is used to discriminate these rival hypotheses with the aid of recent releases of supernova data. We also attempt to provide and improve another example of Bayesian model comparison, performed between some Friedmann models, using the same data. Our conclusion, which is consistent with other approaches, is that the apparent magnitude- redshift data alone cannot discriminate these competing hypotheses. We also argue that the lessons learned using Bayesian theory are extremely valuable to avoid frequent U- turns in cosmology.	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
Vacuum fluctuations of energy density can lead to the observed cosmological constant	10.1088/0264-9381/22/17/L01	The energy density associated with the Planck length is rho(UV) alpha L-p(-4) while the energy density associated with the Hubble length is rho(IR) alpha LHH-4 where L-H = 1/H. The observed value of the dark energy density is quite different from either of these and is close to the geometric mean of the two: rho(vac) similar or equal to root rho(UV)rho(IR). It is argued that classical gravity is actually a probe of the vacuum fluctuations of energy density rather than the energy density itself. While the globally defined ground state, being an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, will not have any fluctuations, the ground-state energy in the finite region of space bounded by the cosmic horizon will exhibit fluctuations Delta rho vac(L-P, L-H) When used as a source of gravity, this Delta p should lead to a spacetime with a horizon size, L-H. This bootstrapping condition leads naturally to an effective dark energy density Delta p alpha (LUVLH)(-2) alpha H =(2)/G, which is precisely the observed value. The model requires either (i) a stochastic fluctuation of vacuum energy which is correlated over about a Hubble time or (ii) a semi-anthropic interpretation. The implications are discussed.

The quiescent Hubble flow, local dark energy tests, and pairwise velocity dispersion in ohm=1 universe	10.1051/0004-6361:20053139	We review the increasing evidence for the cosmological relevance of the cold local Hubble flow. New observations, N-body simulations and other theoretical arguments are discussed, supporting our previous suggestion that the cosmological vacuum or uniform dark energy can have locally observable consequencies, especially a lower velocity scatter in DE dominated regions. The apparent contradiction between the slight dependence of the growth factor on Omega(Lambda) and the significant influence of dark energy in realistic N-body calculations is clarified. An interesting new result is that in the standard Lambda cosmology, gravitation dominates around a typical matter fluctuation up to about the correlation length r(0), and we tentatively link this with the high pairwise velocity dispersion on scales up to several Mpc, as measured from galaxy redshift-space correlations. Locally, the smooth Hubble flow on similar scales is consistent with N-body simulations including Omega(Lambda) approximate to 0.7 and a low density contrast in the Local Volume, which make it generally vacuum-dominated beyond 1- 2 Mpc from galaxies and groups. We introduce a useful way to view the Hubble flow in terms of ``zero gravity{''} spheres around galaxies: e. g., a set of non-intersecting spheres, observed to be expanding, actually participates in accelerating expansion. The observed insensitiveness of the local velocity dispersion to galaxy mass is explained as an effect of the vacuum, too.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Scalar gravity and higgs mechanism	10.1007/s10773-005-4782-y	The role that the auxiliary scalar field phi plays in Brans-Dicke cosmology is discussed. If a constant vacuum energy is assumed to be the origin of dark energy, then the corresponding density parameter would be a quantity varying with phi; and almost all of the fundamental components of our universe can be unified into the dynamical equation for phi. As a generalization of Brans-Dicke theory, we propose a new gravity theory with a complex scalar field phi which is coupled to the cosmological curvature scalar. Through such a coupling, the Higgs mechanism is naturally incorporated into the evolution of the universe, and a running density of the field vacuum energy is obtained which may release the particle standard model from the rigorous cosmological constant problem in some sense. Our model predicts a running mass scale of the fundamental particles in which the gauge symmetry breaks spontaneously. The running speed of the mass scale in our case could survive all existing experiments.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS

Casimir energies for 6D supergravities compactified on T-2/Z(N) with Wilson lines		We compute ( as functions of the shape and Wilson-line moduli) the one-loop Casimir energy induced by higher-dimensional supergravities compactified from 6D to 4D on 2-tori, and on some of their Z(N) orbifolds. Detailed calculations are given for a 6D scalar field having an arbitrary 6D mass m, and we show how to extend these results to higher-spin fields for supersymmetric 6D theories. Particular attention is paid to regularization issues and to the identification of the divergences of the potential, as well as the dependence of the result on m, including limits for which m(2) A << 1 and m(2) A >> 1 where A is the volume of the internal 2 dimensions. Our calculation extends those in the literature to very general boundary conditions for fields about the various cycles of these geometries. The results have potential applications towards Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions (SLED) as a theory of the Dark Energy. First, they provide an explicit calculation within which to follow the dependence of the result on the mass of the bulk states which travel within the loop, and for heavy masses these results bear out the more general analysis of the UV-sensitivity obtained using heat-kernel methods. Second, because the potentials we find describe the dynamics of the classical flat directions of these compactifications, within SLED they would describe the present-day dynamics of the Dark Energy.

Interpreting cosmological vacuum decay	10.1103/PhysRevD.72.063516	The cosmological vacuum decay scenario recently proposed by Wang and Meng [Classical Quantum Gravity 22, 283 (2005)] is rediscussed. From thermodynamic arguments it is found that the epsilon parameter quantifying the vacuum decay rate must be positive in the presence of particle creation. If there is no particle creation, the proper mass of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particles is necessarily a time-dependent quantity, scaling as m(t)=m(o)a(t)(epsilon). By considering the presence of baryons in the cosmological scenario, it is also shown that their dynamic effect is to alter the transition redshift z({*}) (the redshift at which the Universe switches from decelerating to accelerating expansion), predicting values of z({*}) compatible with current estimates based on type Ia supernova. In order to constrain the Omega(m)-epsilon plane, a joint statistical analysis involving the current supernovae observations, gas mass fraction measurements in galaxy clusters and CMB data is performed. At 95\% c.l. it is found that the vacuum decay rate parameter lies on the interval epsilon=0.06 +/- 0.10. The possibility of a vacuum decay into photons is also analyzed. In this case, the energy density of the radiation fluid scales as rho(r)=rho(ro)a(-4+epsilon), and its temperature evolution law obeys T(t)=T(o)a(t)(epsilon/4-1).	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Hybrid inflation, dark energy and dark matter	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.06.024	It has been suggested that the dark energy density rho upsilon similar to 10(-12) eV(4) in the universe is associated with a metastable (false) vacuum, while the true vacuum has a vanishing cosmological constant. By including supergravity corrections we show how this is naturally realized in realistic supersymmetric hybrid inflation models. With a fundamental supersymmetry breaking scale similar to TeV, the LSP is not a suitable candidate for cold dark matter. We consider axion physics to overcome this and simultaneously provide a resolution of the MSSM mu problem. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
On energy conditions and stability in effective loop quantum cosmology	10.1088/0264-9381/22/13/009	In isotropic loop quantum cosmology, non-perturbatively modified dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field violates weak, strong and dominant energy conditions when they are stated in terms of the equation-of-state parameter. The violation of the strong energy condition helps to have non-singular evolution by evading singularity theorems thus leading to a generic inflationary phase. However, the violation of weak and dominant energy conditions raises concern, as in general relativity these conditions ensure causality of the system and stability of vacuum via the Hawking-Ellis conservation theorem. It is shown here that the non-perturbatively modified kinetic term contributes negative pressure but positive energy density. This crucial feature leads to the violation of energy conditions but ensures the positivity of energy density, as the scalar matter Hamiltonian remains bounded from below. It is also shown that the modified dynamics restricts group velocity for inhomogeneous modes to remain sub-luminal thus ensuring causal propagation across spatial distances.

Stability of phantom wormholes	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.124022	It has recently been shown that traversable wormholes may be supported by phantom energy. In this work phantom wormhole geometries are modeled by matching an interior traversable wormhole solution, governed by the equation of state p=omega rho with omega <-1, to an exterior vacuum spacetime at a finite junction interface. The stability analysis of these phantom wormholes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about static equilibrium solutions is carried out. A master equation dictating the stability regions is deduced, and by separating the cases of a positive and a negative surface energy density, it is found that the respective stable equilibrium configurations may be increased by strategically varying the wormhole throat radius. The first model considered, in the absence of a thin shell, is that of an asymptotically flat phantom wormhole spacetime. The second model constructed is that of an isotropic pressure phantom wormhole, which is of particular interest, as the notion of phantom energy is that of a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid, although it may be extended to inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes.

The flatness problem and Lambda	10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.201102	By way of a complete integration of the Friedmann equations, in terms of observables, it is shown that for the cosmological constant Lambda > 0 there exist nonflat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models for which the total density parameter Omega remains similar to 1 throughout the entire history of the Universe. Further, it is shown that in a precise quantitative sense these models are not finely tuned. When observations are brought to bear on the theory, and, in particular, the Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe observations, they confirm that we live in just such a universe. The conclusion holds when the classical notion of Lambda is extended to dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
Hint for quintessence-like scalars from holographic dark energy	10.1088/1475-2516/2005/05/001	We use the generalized holographic dark energy model, in which both the cosmological constant (CC) and Newton's constant G(N) are scale dependent, to set constraints on the renormalization- group (RG) evolution of both quantities phrased within quantum field theory (QFT) in a curved background. Considering the case in which the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter stays individually conserved, we show from the holographic dark energy requirement that the RG laws for the CC and GN are completely determined in terms of the lowest part of the particle spectrum of an underlying QFT. From simple arguments one can then infer that the lowest-mass fields should have a Compton wavelength comparable with the size of the current Hubble horizon. Hence, although the models with variable CC (or with both the CC and the GN varying) are known to lead to successful cosmologies without introducing a new light degree of freedom, we nonetheless find that holography actually brings us back to the quintessence proposal. An advantage of having two different components of the vacuum energy in the cosmological setting is also briefly mentioned.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Cardassian expansion: dark energy density from modified Friedmann equations	10.1016/j.newar.2005.01.007	The Cardassian universe is a proposed modification to the Friedmann equation in which the universe is flat, matter dominated, and accelerating. In the ordinary Friedmann equation, the right hand side is a linear function of the energy density, H-2 &SIM; &rho;. Here, instead, the right hand side of the Friedmann equation is a different function of the energy density, H-2 &SIM; g(&rho;). This function returns to ordinary Friedmann at early times, but drives acceleration of the universe at the current epoch. The only ingredients in this universe are matter and radiation: in particular, there is NO vacuum contribution. The new term required may arise, e.g., as a consequence of our observable universe living as a three-dimensional brane in a higher dimensional universe. A second possible interpretation of Cardassian expansion is developed, in which we treat the modified Friedman equations as due to a fluid, in which the energy density has new contributions with negative pressure (possibly due to dark matter with self-interactions). Predictions are shown for observational tests of generalized Cardassian models in future supernova surveys. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS
Dark energy: Vacuum fluctuations, the effective phantom phase, and holography	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.103504	We aim at the construction of dark energy models without exotic matter but with a phantomlike equation of state (an effective phantom phase). The first model we consider is decaying vacuum cosmology where the fluctuations of the vacuum are taken into account. In this case, the phantom cosmology (with an effective, observational omega being less than -1 ) emerges even for the case of a real dark energy with a physical equation of state parameter omega larger than -1. The second proposal is a generalized holographic model, which is produced by the presence of an infrared cutoff. It also leads to an effective phantom phase, which is not a transient one as in the first model. However, we show that quantum effects are able to prevent its evolution towards a big rip singularity.

Potentials between D-branes in a supersymmetric model of space-time foam	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.106006	We study a supersymmetric model of space-time foam with two stacks each of eight D8-branes with equal string tensions, separated by a single bulk dimension containing D0-brane particles that represent quantum fluctuations. The ground-state configuration with static D-branes has zero vacuum energy, but, when they move, the interactions among the D-branes and D-particles due to the exchanges of strings result in a nontrivial, positive vacuum energy. We calculate its explicit form in the limits of small velocities and large or small separations between the D-branes and/or the D-particles. This nontrivial vacuum energy appears as a central-charge deficit in the noncritical stringy sigma model describing perturbative string excitations on a moving D-brane. These calculations enable us to characterize the ground state of the D-brane/D-particle system, and provide a framework for discussing brany inflation and the possibility of residual dark energy in the present-day Universe.

Initial state of matter fields and trans-Planckian physics: Can CMB observations disentangle the two?	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.103512	The standard, scale-invariant, inflationary perturbation spectrum will be modified if the effects of trans-Planckian physics are incorporated into the dynamics of the matter field in a phenomenological manner, say, by the modification of the dispersion relation. The spectrum also changes if we retain the standard dynamics but modify the initial quantum state of the matter field. We show that, given any spectrum of perturbations, it is possible to choose a class of initial quantum states which can exactly reproduce this spectrum with the standard dynamics. We provide an explicit construction of the quantum state which will produce the given spectrum. We find that the various modified spectra that have been recently obtained from ``trans-Planckian considerations{''} can be constructed from suitable squeezed states above the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the standard theory. Hence, the CMB observations can, at most, be useful in determining the initial state of the matter field in the standard theory, but it can not help us to discriminate between the various Planck scale models of matter fields. We study the problem in the Schrodinger picture and determine the criterion for negligible back reaction due to modified initial conditions.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Uncorrelated measurements of the cosmic expansion history and dark energy from supernovae	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.103513	We present a method for measuring the cosmic expansion history H(z) in uncorrelated redshift bins, and apply it to current and simulated type Ia supernova data assuming spatial flatness. If the matter density parameter Omega(m) can be accurately measured from other data, then the dark-energy density history X(z)=rho(X)(z)/rho(X)(0) can trivially be derived from this expansion history H(z). In contrast to customary ``black box{''} parameter fitting, our method is transparent and easy to interpret: the measurement of H(z)(-1) in a redshift bin is simply a linear combination of the measured comoving distances for supernovae in that bin, making it obvious how systematic errors propagate from input to output. We find the Riess et al. (2004) gold sample to be consistent with the vanilla concordance model where the dark energy is a cosmological constant. We compare two mission concepts for the NASA/DOE Joint Dark-Energy Mission (JDEM), the Joint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation (JEDI), and the Supernova Accelaration Probe (SNAP), using simulated data including the effect of weak lensing (based on numerical simulations) and a systematic bias from K corrections. Estimating H(z) in seven uncorrelated redshift bins, we find that both provide dramatic improvements over current data: JEDI can measure H(z) to about 10\% accuracy and SNAP to 30\%-40\% accuracy.

Cosmological model with dynamical cancellation of vacuum energy and dark energy	10.1134/1.1935015	We propose a model with a compensating scalar field whose back reaction to the cosmological curvature cancels possible vacuum energy density down to the terms of the order of the time-dependent critical energy density. Thus, the model simultaneously solves the mystery of the compensation of vacuum energy with an accuracy of 120 orders of magnitude and explains the existence of the observed dark energy. At an early stage, the suggested cosmological model might experience exponential expansion without an additional inflaton field. However, the solution found is unstable with respect to small perturbations. The stability can be ensured by introducing nonanalytical terms depending upon the absolute value of the curvature scalar R. Unfortunately, stable solutions do not describe realistic cosmology at the matter-dominated stage. (c) 2005 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.	PHYSICS OF ATOMIC NUCLEI

Dynamical instability of fluid spheres in the presence of a cosmological constant	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.084026	The equations describing the adiabatic, small radial oscillations of general relativistic stars are generalized to include the effects of a cosmological constant. The generalized eigenvalue equation for the normal modes is used to study the changes in the stability of the homogeneous sphere induced by the presence of the cosmological constant. The variation of the critical adiabatic index as a function of the central pressure is studied numerically for different trial functions. The presence of a large cosmological constant significantly increases the value of the critical adiabatic index. The dynamical stability condition of the homogeneous star in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry is obtained and several bounds on the maximum allowable value for a cosmological constant are derived from stability considerations.

Expansion around the vacuum equation of state: Sudden future singularities and asymptotic behavior	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.084024	The dark energy model with the equation of state p(d)=-rho(d)-A rho(d)(alpha) is studied. The model comprises and provides realization of several types of singularities in different parameter regimes: the divergence of the dark energy density and pressure at finite time and finite value of the scale factor, the singularity of the ``big rip{''} type and the sudden future singularity recently introduced by Barrow. For parameter choices which lead to a nonsingular expansion of the universe, various types of the asymptotic evolution are found. The entire time evolution of the universe is described both analytically and numerically. The advantages of this dark energy EOS as a parametrization of dark energy are discussed.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Holographic principle and dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2005.02.006	We discuss the relationship between holographic entropy bounds and gravitating systems. In order to obtain a holographic energy density, we introduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH and its corresponding energy EBH using the Friedman equation. We show that the holographic energy bound proposed by Cohen et al. comes from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound for a weakly gravitating system. Also we find that the holographic energy density with the future event horizon deriving an accelerating universe could be given by vacuum fluctuations of the energy density. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A conjecture on the origin of dark energy		A conjecture on the origin of the dark energy in our universe is proposed. The analysis indicates that the dark energy may originate from the quantum fluctuations of space-time limited in our universe. Applying both the uncertainty principle and the holographic principle, the author finds that the density of such quantum fluctuation energy is pv = 3c(4)/32GL(H)(2), where L-H is the size of the event horizon of our universe and G is the gravitational constant. Using this dark energy model which contains no adjustable parameters, we obtain the current fraction Omega(Lambda) &3bond; pv/p(c) approximate to pi/4 and the corresponding equation of state w(z) approximate to -1 + (1 - pi/4)z with p, being the critical energy density. These theoretical results are perfectly consistent with the recent cosmological observations. The striking coincidence implies that the quantum fluctuation energy of space-time may be the only source of dark energy. In addition, the analysis shows that the vacuum fluctuation energy does exist, but it comes from space time rather than matter. This may have some deep implications for discrete space-time and quantum gravity.	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
Generalized gravity and a ghost	10.1088/1475-7516/2005/03/008	We show that generalized gravity theories involving the curvature invariants of the Ricci tensor and the Riemann tensor as well as the Ricci scalar are equivalent to multi-scalar-tensor gravities with four-derivative terms. By expanding the action around a vacuum spacetime, the action is reduced to that of the Einstein gravity with four-derivative terms, and consequently there appears a massive spin-2 ghost in such generalized gravity theories in addition to a massive spin-0.

Supernovae constraints on models of dark energy reexamined	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.063501	We use the Type la Supernova gold sample data of Riess et al in order to constrain three models of dark energy. We study the Cardassian model, the Dvali-Turner gravity modified model, and the generalized Chaplygin gas model of dark energy-dark matter unification. In our best-fit analysis for these three dark energy proposals we consider the flat model and the nonflat model priors. We also discuss the degeneracy of the models with the XCDM model through the computation of the so-called jerk parameter.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Can vacuum decay in our universe?	10.1088/0264-9381//22/2/003	We take a phenomenological approach to the study of the cosmological evolution of decaying vacuum cosmology (Lambda(t)CDM) based on a simple assumption about the form of the modified matter expansion rate. In this framework, almost all current vacuum decaying models can be unified in a simple manner. We argue that the idea of letting vacuum decay to resolve the fine-tuning problem is inconsistent with cosmological observations. We also discuss some issues in confronting Lambda(t)CDM with observation. Using the effective equation-of-state formalism, we indicate that Lambda(t)CDM is a possible candidate for phantom cosmology. Moreover, confronted with a possible problem with the effective equation-of-state formalism, we construct the effective dark energy density. Finally, we discuss the evolution of linear perturbation.

Could dark energy be measured in the lab?	10.1016/j.physletb.2004.11.060	The experimentally measured spectral density of current noise in Josephson junctions provides direct evidence for the existence of zero-point fluctuations. Assuming that the total vacuum energy associated with these fluctuations cannot exceed the presently measured dark energy of the universe, we predict an upper cutoff frequency of nu(c) = (1.69 +/- 0.05) x 10(12) Hz for the measured frequency spectrum of zero-point fluctuations in the Josephson junction. The largest frequencies that have been reached in the experiments are of the same order of magnitude as v, and provide a lower bound on the dark energy density of the universe. It is shown that suppressed zero-point fluctuations above a given cutoff frequency can lead to 1/f noise. We propose an experiment which may help to measure some of the properties of dark energy in the lab. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Dark energy and Type Ia supernovae		Observational cosmology is currently experiencing a revolution. The measurements of magnitude versus redshift of very distant Type la supernovae indicate that the expansion rate of the Universe is increasing. The acceleration of the Universe requires the existence of a `dark energy' component that overcomes the gravitational self-attraction of matter, such as the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant (A). Understanding the nature of dark energy, weather constant or dynamical, is among the most fundamental questions in contemporary science. Some of the most critical systematic effects involved in the use of Type la supernovae as distance indicators are discussed.	1604-2004: Supernovae as Cosmological Lighthouses
Accelerated expansion from braneworld models with variable vacuum energy	10.1007/s10714-005-0003-5	We study the acceleration of the universe as a consequence of the time evolution of the vacuum energy in cosmological models based in braneworld theories in 5D. A variable vacuum energy may appear if the size of the extra dimension changes during the evolution of the universe. In this scenario the acceleration of the universe is related not only to the variation of the cosmological term, but also to the time evolution of G and, possibly, to the variation of other fundamental `` constants{''} as well. This is because the expansion rate of the extra dimension appears in different contexts, notably in expressions concerning the variation of rest mass and electric charge. We concentrate our attention on spatially- flat, homogeneous and isotropic, brane- universes where the matter density decreases as an inverse power of the scale factor, similar ( but at different rate) to the power law in FRW- universes of general relativity. We show that these braneworld cosmologies are consistent with the observed accelerating universe and other observational requirements. In particular, G becomes constant and Lambda((4)) approximate to const x H-2 asymptotically in time. Another important feature is that the models contain no `` adjustable{''} parameters. All the quantities, even the five- dimensional ones, can be evaluated by means of measurements in 4D. We provide precise constrains on the cosmological parameters and demonstrate that the `` effective{''} equation of state of the universe can, in principle, be determined by measurements of the deceleration parameter alone. We give an explicit expression relating the density parameters Omega(rho) , Omega(Lambda)and the deceleration parameter q. These results constitute concrete predictions that may help in observations for an experimental/ observational test of the model.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION

The acceleration of the universe requires the existence of a `dark energy' component that overcomes the gravitational self-attraction of matter, such as the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant (A).

Locked quintessence and cold dark matter	10.1142/9789812701848\_0002	A supersymmetric hybrid potential model with low energy supersymmetry breaking scale (M-S similar to 1 - 10Tev) is presented for both dark matter and dark energy. Cold dark matter is associated with a light modulus field (similar to 10 - 100Mev) undergoing coherent oscillations around a saddle point false vacuum with the presently observed energy density (rho o similar to 10(-12)eV(4)). The latter is generated by its coupling to a light dark energy scalar field (similar to 10(-18)eV) which is trapped at the origin ({''}locked quintessence{''}). Through naturally attained initial conditions the model is consistent with cosmic coincidence reproducing LCDM cosmology. An exit from the cosmic acceleration phase is estimated to occur within some eight Hubble times.	Identification of Dark Matter
Emergence of space-time localization and cosmic decoherence: More on irreversible time, dark energy, anti-matter and black-holes	10.1142/9789812701848\_0007	A non geometric cosmology is presented, based on logic of observability, where logical categories of our perception set frontiers to comprehensibility. The Big-Bang singularity finds here a substitute (comparable to a ``quantum jump{''}) : a logical process (tied to self-referent and divisible totality) by which information emerges, focalizes on events and recycles, providing a transition from incoherence to causal coherence. This jump manufactures causal order and space-time localization, as exact solutions to Einstein's equation, where the last step of the process disentangles complex Riemann spheres into real null-cones (a geometric overturning imposed by self-reference, reminding us of our ability to project the cosmos within our mental sphere). Concepts such as antimatter and dark energy (dual entities tied to bifurcations or broken symmetries, and their compensation), are presented as hidden in the virtual potentialities, while irreversible time appears with the recycling of information and related flow. Logical bifurcations (such as the ``part-totality{''} category. a quantum of information which owes its recycling to non localizable logical separations, as anticipated by unstability or horizon dependence of the quantum vacuum) induce broken symmetries, at the (complex or real) geometric level [eg. the antiselfdual complex non linear graviton solutions, which break duality symmetry, provide a model for (hidden) anti-matter, itself compensated with dark-energy, and providing, with spacetime localization, the radiative gravitational energy (Bondi flux and related bifurcations' of the peeling off type), as well as mass of isolated bodies]. These bifurcations are compensated by inertial effects (non geometric precursors of the Coriolis forces) able to explain (on logical grounds) the cosmic expansion (a repulsion?) and critical equilibrium or the cosmic tissue. Space-time environment, itself, emerges through the jump. as a censor to totality, a screen to incoherence (as anticipated by black-hole event horizons. cosmic censors able to shelter causal geometry). In analogy with black-hole singularities, the Big-Bang can be viewed as a geometric hint that a transition from incoherence to (causal space-time) localization and related coherence (comprehensibility), is taking place (space-time demolition, a reverse process towards incoherence or information recycling, is expected in the vicinity of singularities. as hinted by black-holes and related ``time-machines{''}). A theory of the emergence of perception (and life?), in connection with observability and the function of partition (able to screen totalitv), is oil its way [interface incoherence-coherence, sleeping and awaking states of localization. horizons of perception etc, are anticipated by black-hole event horizons, beyond which a non causal, dimensionless incoherent regime or memorization process, presents itself with the loss of localization, suggesting- a unifying regime (ultimate energies?) hidden in cosmic potentialities]. The decoherence process presented here, suggests an ultimate interaction, expression of the logical relation of subsystems to totality. and to be identified to the flow of information or its recycling through cosmic jump (this is anticipated by the dissipation of distance or hierarchies on null-cones, themselves recycled with information and events). The geometric projection of this unified irreversible dynamics is expressed by unified Yang-Mills field equations (coupled to Einsteinian gravity). An ultimate form of action ( ``set ``-volumes of information) presents itsef, whose extrema can be achieved through extremal transfer of information and related partition of cells of information (thus anticipating the mitosis of living cells, possibly triggered at the non localizable level, as imposed by the logical regime of cosmic decolierence: participating subsystems ?). The matching of the objective and subjective facets of (information and) decoherences is perceived as contact with a reality.	Identification of Dark Matter
New physics at low energies and dark matter-dark energy transmutation		A field theory is proposed where the regular fermionic matter and the dark fermionic matter can be different states of the same ``primordial{''} fermion fields. In regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, the primordial fermions split into three families identified with regular fermions. When fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density, the theory allows transition to new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory equations describing FRW universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Neutrinos in CLEP state are drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own parameters. One of the features of the fermions in CLEP state is that in the late time universe their masses increase as a(3/2) (a = a(t) is the scale factor). The energy density of the cold dark matter consisting of neutrinos in CLEP state scales as a sort of dark energy; this cold dark matter possesses negative pressure and for the late time universe its equation of state approaches that of the cosmological constant. The total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at all.	LAUNCHING OF LA BELLE EPOQUE OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS \& COSMOLOGY
Why is the universe accelerating?		The Universe appears to be accelerating, but the reason is a complete mystery. The simplest explanation, a small vacuum energy (cosmological constant), raises three difficult issues: why the vacuum energy is so small, why it is not quite zero, and why it is comparable to the matter density today. I discuss these mysteries, some of their possible resolutions, and some issues confronting future observations.	OBSERVING DARK ENERGY, PROCEEDINGS
New field theory effect at energy densities close to the dark energy density	10.1142/9789812701756\_0017	An alternative gravity and matter fields theory is studied where the consistency condition of equations of motion yields strong correlation between states of ``primordial{''} fermion fields and local value of the dark energy. The same ``primordial{''} fermion field at different densities can be either in states of regular fermionic matter or in states presumably corresponding to the dark fermionic matter. In regime of the fermion densities typical for normal particle physics, each of the primordial fermions splits into three generations identified with regular fermions. When restricting ourselves to the first two fermion generations, the theory reproduces general relativity and regular particle theory. When fermion energy density is comparable with vacuum energy density, the theory allows new type of states. The possibility of such Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states is demonstrated by means of solutions of the field theory equations describing FRW universe filled by homogeneous scalar field and uniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos. Primordial neutrinos in CLEP state are drawn into cosmological expansion by means of dynamically changing their own parameters. Some of the features of the CLEP state in the late time universe: the mass of the primordial neutrino increases as a(3/2) (a = a(t) is the scale factor); its energy density scales as a sort of dark energy and approaches constant as a -> infinity; this cold dark matter possesses negative pressure and its equation of state approaches that of the cosmological constant as a -> infinity; the total energy density of such universe is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at all. The latter means that nonrelativistic neutrinos are able to produce expanding bubbles of the CLEP state playing the role of a true ``cosmological vacuum{''} sorrounded by a ``regular{''} vacuum.

Preheating and the dark sector of the universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.71.027302	Regarding long-life particle produced during preheating after inflation as dark matter, we find that its backreaction on the field phi can lock phi in a false vacuum up to today under certain conditions. This false vacuum can drive the accelerated expansion of universe at late time and play the role of dark energy. When the number density of dark matter particle is diluted to some value, the field phi will become tachyonic and roll to its true minimum rapidly, and the acceleration of universe ceases. We discuss the constraints on the parameters of model from the observations.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark matter and dark energy		I briefly review our current understanding of dark matter and dark energy. The first part of this review focusses on issues pertaining to dark matter including observational evidence for its existence, current constraints and the `abundance of substructure' and `cuspy core' issues which arise in CDM. I also briefly describe MOND. The second part of this review focusses on dark energy. In this part I discuss the significance of the cosmological constant problem which leads to a predicted value of the cosmological constant which is almost 10, 2,3 times larger than the observed value lambda/8piG similar or equal to 10(-47) GeV4. Setting A to this small value ensures that the acceleration of the universe is a fairly recent phenomenon giving rise to the `cosmic coincidence' conundrum according to which we live during a special epoch when the density in matter and A are almost equal. Anthropic arguments are briefly discussed but more emphasis is placed upon dynamical dark energy models in which the equation of state is time dependent. These include Quintessence, Braneworld models, Chaplygin gas and Phantom energy. Model independent methods to determine the cosmic equation of state and the Statefinder diagnostic are also discussed, The Statefinder has the attractive property (a) triple over dot /aH(3) = 1 for LCDM, which is helpful for differentiating between LCDM and rival dark energy models. The review ends with a brief discussion of the fate of the universe in dark energy models.	PHYSICS OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE
Dark energy, dark matter and fermion families in the two measures theory	10.1142/S0217751X04022542	A field theory is proposed where the regular fermionic matter and the dark fermionic matter are different states of the same ``primordial{''} fermion fields.

In a simple model, this fermion families birth effect is accompanied with the right lepton numbers conservation laws. It is possible to fit the muon to electron mass ratio without fine tuning of the Yukawa coupling constants. When fermion energy density becomes comparable with dark energy density the theory allows new type of states - Cosmo-Low Energy Physics (CLEP) states. Neutrinos in GLEP state can be both a good candidate for dark matter and responsible for a new type of dark energy. In the latter case the total energy density of the universe is less than it would be in the universe free of fermionic matter at all. The (quintessence) scalar field is coupled to dark matter but its coupling to regular fermionic matter appears to be extremely suppressed.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS A
Palatini formulation of modified gravity with squared scalar curvature	10.1023/B:GERG.0000048981.40061.63	In this paper we show that in the Palatini formulation of modified gravity, a R-2 term cannot lead to an early time inflation, in opposite to the well-known conclusion when considering this model in the metric formulation.

Extra dimensions and vacuum dark energy models		The role of vacuum energy or cosmological constant in cosmology is discussed in a kind of nontrivial higher-dimensional model. Under the framework of Einstein's gravity, we obtain the corresponding equations of motion and find that the cosmological constant and vacuum energy in the full regime does not drive its acceleration, but decelerates the expansion of the universe. The dimension of space is required to be n = 3 if we regard vacuum energy or cosmological constant as the candidate to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe.	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS
Quantum effects can render w <-1 on cosmological scales	10.1103/PhysRevD.70.107301	We report on a revision of our previous computation of the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of a massless, minimally coupled scalar with a quartic self-interaction on a locally de Sitter background. This model is important because it demonstrates that quantum effects can lead to violations of the weak energy condition on cosmological scales-on average, not just in fluctuations-although the effect in this particular model is far too small to be observed. The revision consists of modifying the propagator so that dimensional regularization can be used when the dimension of the renormalized theory is not four. Although the finite part of the stress-energy tensor does not change (in D=4) from our previous result, the counterterms do. We also speculate that a certain, finite and separately conserved part of the stress tensor can be subsumed into a natural correction of the initial state from free Bunch-Davies vacuum.

Dark matter and background light	10.1016/j.physrep.2004.07.006	Progress in observational cosmology over the past five years has established that the Universe is dominated dynamically by dark matter and dark energy. Both these new and apparently independent forms of matter-energy have properties that are inconsistent with anything in the existing standard model of particle physics, and it appears that the latter must be extended. We review what is known about dark matter and energy from their impact on the light of the night sky. Most of the candidates that have been proposed so far are not perfectly black, but decay into or otherwise interact with photons in characteristic ways that can be accurately modelled and compared with observational data. We show how experimental limits on the intensity of cosmic background radiation in the microwave, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma-ray bands put strong limits on decaying vacuum energy, light axions, neutrinos, unstable weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and objects like black holes. Our conclusion is that the dark matter is most likely to be WIMPs if conventional cosmology holds; or higher-dimensional sources if spacetime needs to be extended. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Thermodynamics, spectral distribution and the nature of dark energy	10.1016/j.physletb.2004.09.013	Recent astronomical observations suggest that the bulk of energy in the universe is repulsive and appears like a dark component with negative pressure (omega equivalent to p(x) / rho(x) < 0).In this Letter we investigate thermodynamic and statistical properties of such a component. It is found that its energy and temperature grow during the evolution of the universe since work is done on the system. Under the hypothesis of a null chemical potential, the case of phantom energy (omega < -1) seems to be physically meaningless because its entropy is negative. It is also proved that the wavelengths of the omega-quanta decrease in an expanding universe. This unexpected behavior explains how their energy may be continuously stored in the course of expansion. The spectrum and the associated Wien-type law favors a fermionic nature with omega naturally restricted to the interval -1 less than or equal to omega < -1/2. Our analysis also implies that the ultimate fate of the universe may be considerably modified. If a dark energy dominated universe expands forever. it will become increasingly hot. (C) Elsevier B.V.

Galactic systems against the background of the cosmic vacuum: Structure and evolution of the zero-acceleration surface	10.1134/1.1809391	\textbackslash{}The structure and evolution of the zero-acceleration surface around wide triple systems of galaxies are studied in detail. (The zero-acceleration surface is the boundary separating regions in which (i) the Newtonian gravitational attraction of the galactic matter and (ii) the Einsteinian universal repulsion of the cosmic vacuum dominate.) For a typical system, this surface is spherical in shape and several megaparsecs in size, and remains nearly unchanged throughout the lifetime of the system. The concept of a boundary surface can also be extended to systems on the largest possible scales, and its general properties are discussed in relation to clusters, superclusters, and voids.

Acceleressence: dark energy from a phase transition at the seesaw scale	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/10/011	Simple models are constructed for `acceleressence' dark energy: the latent heat of a phase transition occurring in a hidden sector governed by the seesaw mass scale v(2)/M-Pl, where v is the electroweak scale and M-Pl the gravitational mass scale. In our models, the seesaw scale is stabilized by supersymmetry, implying that the LHC must discover superpartners with a spectrum that reflects a low scale of fundamental supersymmetry breaking. Newtonian gravity may be modified by effects arising from the exchange of fields in the acceleressence sector whose Compton wavelengths are typically of order the millimetre scale. There are two classes of models. In the first class the universe is currently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to in. ate until tunnelling processes eventually induce a first-order transition. In the simplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25 mum in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of order unity it is expected to be approximate to100 mum. In the second class of models thermal effects maintain the present vacuum energy of the universe, but on further cooling, the universe will `soon' smoothly relax to a matter dominated era. In this case, the range of the new force is also expected to be of order the millimetre scale or larger, although its strength is uncertain. A firm prediction of this class of models is the existence of additional energy density in radiation at the eV era, which can potentially be probed in precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. An interesting possibility is that the transition towards a matter dominated era has occurred in the very recent past, with the consequence that the universe is currently decelerating.

Revival of the unified dark energy-dark matter model?	10.1103/PhysRevD.70.083519	We consider the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) proposal for unification of dark energy and dark matter and show that it admits an unique decomposition into dark energy and dark matter components once phantomlike dark energy is excluded. Within this framework, we study structure formation and show that difficulties associated to unphysical oscillations or blowup in the matter power spectrum can be circumvented. Furthermore, we show that the dominance of dark energy is related to the time when energy density fluctuations start deviating from the linear deltasimilar toa behavior.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Nonminimal coupling, exponential potentials and the w <-1 regime of dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.70.087302	Recent observations and theoretical considerations have motivated the study of models for dark energy with equation of state characterized by a parameter w=p/rho<-1. Such models, however, are usually believed to be inviable due to their instabilities against classical perturbations or potentially catastrophic vacuum decays. In this Brief Report, we show that a simple quintessential model with potential V(phi)=Ae(-sigmaphi) and a gravitational coupling of the form (1+|xi|phi(2))R can exhibit, for large sets of initial conditions, asymptotic de Sitter behavior with w<-1 regimes. Nevertheless, the model is indeed stable at classical and quantum level.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
The Casimir effect: recent controversies and progress	10.1088/0305-4470/37/38/R01	The phenomena implied by the existence of quantum vacuum fluctuations, grouped under the title of the Casimir effect, are reviewed, with emphasis on new results discovered in the past four years. The Casimir force between parallel plates is rederived as the strong-coupling limit of delta-function potential planes. The role of surface divergences is clarified. A summary of effects relevant to measurements of the Casimir force between real materials is given, starting from a geometrical optics derivation of the Lifshitz formula, and including a rederivation of the Casimir-Polder forces. A great deal of attention is given to the recent controversy concerning temperature corrections to the Casimir force between real metal surfaces. A summary of new improvements to the proximity force approximation is given, followed by a synopsis of the current experimental situation. New results on Casimir self-stress are reported, again based on delta-function potentials. Progress in understanding divergences in the self-stress of dielectric bodies is described, in particular the status of a continuing calculation of the. self-stress of a dielectric cylinder. Casimir effects for solitons, and the status of the so-called dynamical Casimir effect, are summarized. The possibilities of understanding dark energy, strongly constrained by both cosmological and terrestrial experiments, in terms of quantum fluctuations are discussed. Throughout, the centrality of quantum vacuum energy in fundamental physics is emphasized.	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL
Studying the decay of the vacuum energy with the observed density fluctuation spectrum	10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063529	We investigate here models that suggest that the vacuum energy decays into cold dark matter (CDM) and show that the density fluctuation spectrum obtained from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data together with large galaxy surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey), puts strong limits on the rate of decay of the vacuum energy. CDM produced by a decaying vacuum energy would dilute the density fluctuation spectrum, created in the primordial universe and observed with large galaxy surveys at low redshifts. Our results indicate that the decay rate of the vacuum energy into CDM is extremely small.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Space-time foam and cosmic-ray interactions	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2004.04.008	It has been proposed that propagation of cosmic-rays at extreme-energy may be sensitive to Lorentz-violating metric fluctuations ({''}foam{''}). We investigate the changes in interaction thresholds for cosmic-rays and gamma-rays interacting on the CMB and IR backgrounds, for a class of stochastic models of space-time foam. The strength of the foam is characterized by the factor (E/M-P)(a), where a is a phenomenological suppression parameter. We find that there exists a critical value of a (dependent on the particular reaction: a(crit) similar to 3 for cosmic-rays, similar to1 for gamma-rays), below which the threshold energy can only be lowered, and above which the threshold energy may be raised, but at most by a factor of two. Thus, it does not appear possible in this class of models to extend cosmic-ray spectra significantly beyond their classical absorption energies. However, the lower thresholds resulting from foam may have signatures in the cosmic-ray spectrum. In the context of this foam model we find that cosmic-ray energies cannot exceed the fundamental Planck scale, and so set a lower bound of 10(8) TeV for the scale of gravity. We also find that suppression of p --> ppi (0) and gamma --> e(-)e(+) ``decays{''} favors values a greater than or similar to a(crit). Finally, we comment on the apparent non-conservation of particle energy-momentum, and speculate on its re-emergence as dark energy in the foamy vacuum. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neutrino oscillations as a probe of dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.091801	We consider a class of theories in which neutrino masses depend significantly on environment, as a result of interactions with the dark sector. Such theories of mass varying neutrinos were recently introduced to explain the origin of the cosmological dark energy density and why its magnitude is apparently coincidental with that of neutrino mass splittings. In this Letter we argue that in such theories neutrinos can exhibit different masses in matter and in vacuum, dramatically affecting neutrino oscillations. As an example of modifications to the standard picture, we consider simple models that may simultaneously account for the LSND anomaly, KamLAND, K2K, and studies of solar and atmospheric neutrinos, while providing motivation to continue to search for neutrino oscillations in short baseline experiments such as BooNE.

Partial rip scenario - a cosmology with a growing cosmological term	10.1016/j.physletb.2004.04.081	A cosmology with the growing cosmological term is considered. If there is no exchange of energy between vacuum and matter components, the requirement of general covariance implies the time dependence of the gravitational constant G. Irrespectively of the exact functional form of the cosmological term growth, the universe ends in a de Sitter regime with a constant asymptotic A, but vanishing G. Although there is no divergence of the scale factor in finite time, such as in the ``Big Rip{''} scenario, gravitationally bound systems eventually become unbound. In the case of systems bound by non-gravitational forces, there is no unbounding effect, as the asymptotic A is insufficiently large to disturb these systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The existence of an old quasar at z=3.91 and its implications for Lambda(t) deflationary cosmologies	10.1142/S0218271804005481	We investigate some observational constraints on decaying vacuum cosmologies based on the recently discovered old high redshift quasar APM 08279+5255. This object is located at z = 3.91 and has an estimated age of 2-3 Cyr. The class of Lambda(t) cosmologies is characterized by a positive beta parameter smaller than unity which quantifies the ratio between the vacuum and the total energy density. Assuming the lower limit age (2 Gyr) and that the cold dark matter contributes with Omega(M) = 0.2 we show that beta is constrained to be greater than or equal to 0.07 while for an age of 3 Cyr and Omega(M) = 0.4 the beta parameter must be greater than 0.32. Our analysis includes closed, flat and hyperbolic scenarios, and it strongly suggests that there is no age crisis for this kind of A(t) cosmologies. Lower limits to the redshift quasar formation are also briefly discussed to the flat case. For Omega(M) = 0.4 we found that the redshift formation is constrained by z(f) greater than or equal to 8.0.

On the width of the last scattering surface	10.1142/S0218271804005638	We discuss the physical effects of some accelerated world models on the width of the last scattering surface (LSS) of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). The models considered in our analysis are X-matter (XCDM) and a Chaplygin type gas. The redshift of the LSS does not depend on the kind of dark energy (if XCDM of Chaplygin). Further, for a Chaplygin gas, the width of the LSS is also only weakly dependent on the kind of scenario (if we have dark energy plus cold dark matter or the unified picture).

Dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant and matter creation in the Universe	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/08/015	In this paper we discuss the issues of the graceful exit from inflation and of matter creation in the context of a recent scenario in which the back-reaction of long-wavelength cosmological perturbations induces a negative contribution to the cosmological constant and leads to a dynamical relaxation of the bare cosmological constant. The initially large cosmological constant gives rise to primordial inflation, during which cosmological perturbations are stretched beyond the Hubble radius. The cumulative effect of the long-wavelength fluctuations back-reacts on the background geometry in a form which corresponds to the addition of a negative effective cosmological constant to the energy momentum tensor. In the absence of an effective scalar field driving inflation, whose decay can reheat the Universe, the challenge is to find a mechanism which produces matter at the end of the relaxation process. In this paper, we point out that the decay of a condensate representing the order parameter for a `flat' direction in the field theory moduli space can naturally provide a matter generation mechanism. The order parameter is displaced from its vacuum value by thermal or quantum fluctuations, it is frozen until the Hubble constant drops to a sufficiently low value, and then begins to oscillate about its ground state. During the period of oscillation it can decay into standard model particles similar to how the inflaton decays in scalar-field-driven models of inflation.

Supersymmetric D-brane model of space-time foam	10.1103/PhysRevD.70.044036	We present a supersymmetric model of space-time foam with two stacks of eight D8-branes with equal string tensions, separated by a single bulk dimension containing D0-brane particles that represent quantum fluctuations in the space-time foam. The ground-state configuration with static D-branes has zero vacuum energy. However, gravitons and other closed-string states propagating through the bulk may interact with the D0-particles, causing them to recoil and the vacuum energy to become non-zero. This provides a possible origin of dark energy. Recoil also distorts the background metric felt by energetic massless string states, which travel at less than the usual (low-energy) velocity of light. On the other hand, the propagation of chiral matter fields anchored on the D8-branes is not affected by such space-time foam effects.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Hybrid dark sector: locked quintessence and dark matter	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/07/010	We present a unified model of dark matter and dark energy. The dark matter field is a modulus corresponding to a. at direction of supersymmetry, which couples, in a hybrid type potential, with the dark energy field. The latter is a light scalar, whose direction is stabilized by non-renormalizable terms. This quintessence field is kept `locked' on top of a false vacuum due to the coupling with the oscillating dark matter field. It is shown that the model can satisfy the observations when we consider low-scale gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. The necessary initial conditions are naturally attained by the action of supergravity corrections on the potential, in the period following the end of primordial inflation.

Testing the cosmological constant as a candidate for dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/07/001	It is difficult to single out the best model of dark energy on the basis of the existing and planned cosmological observations, because the parameter space of many different models can lead to similar observational consequences. However, each particular model can be studied and either found consistent with observations or ruled out. In this paper, we concentrate on the possibility of testing and ruling out the simplest and by far the most popular of the models of dark energy, the theory described by general relativity with positive vacuum energy ( the cosmological constant). We evaluate the conditions under which this model could be ruled out by future observations made by the Supernova/Acceleration Probe SNAP (both for supernovae and weak lensing) and by the Planck Surveyor cosmic microwave background satellite.

Dilatonic ghost condensate as dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/07/004	We explore a dark energy model with a ghost scalar field in the context of the runaway dilaton scenario in low-energy effective string theory. We address the problem of vacuum stability by implementing higher-order derivative terms and show that a cosmologically viable model of `phantomized' dark energy can be constructed without violating the stability of quantum fluctuations. We also analytically derive the condition under which cosmological scaling solutions exist, starting from a general Lagrangian including the phantom type scalar field. We apply this method to the case where the dilaton is coupled to non-relativistic dark matter and find that the system tends to become quantum mechanically unstable when a constant coupling is always present. Nevertheless, it is possible to obtain a viable cosmological solution in which the energy density of the dilaton eventually approaches the present value of dark energy provided that the coupling rapidly grows during the transition to the scalar field dominated era.

Anthropic predictions for vacuum energy and neutrino masses	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/07/005	It is argued that the observed vacuum energy density and the small values of the neutrino masses could be due to anthropic selection effects. Until now, these two quantities have been treated separately from each other and, in particular, anthropic predictions for the vacuum energy were made under the assumption of zero neutrino masses. Here we consider two cases. In the first, we calculate predictions for the vacuum energy for a fixed ( generally nonzero) value of the neutrino mass. In the second we allow both quantities to vary from one part of the Universe to another. We find that the anthropic predictions for the vacuum energy density are in a better agreement with observations when one allows for nonzero neutrino masses. We also find that the individual distributions for vacuum energy and the neutrino masses are reasonably robust and do not change drastically when one adds the other variable.

Accelerated expansion and the Goldstone ghost		A vacuum instability due to a massless ghost in a hidden sector can lead to an effective equation of state for dark energy that changes smoothly from w=-3/2 at large redshifts, to wapproximate to1.2 today, to w=-1 in the future. We discuss how this ghost can be the Goldstone boson of Lorentz symmetry breaking, and we find that this breaking in the hidden sector should occur at a scale below similar to10 KeV. The normal particles that are produced along with the ghosts are then predominantly neutrinos.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
New dark energy constraints from supernovae, microwave background, and galaxy clustering	10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.241302	Using supernova, cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clustering data, we make the most accurate measurements to date of the dark energy density rho(X) as a function of cosmic time, constraining it in a rather model-independent way, assuming a flat universe. We find that Einstein's simplest scenario, where rho(X)(z) is constant, remains consistent with these new tight constraints and that a big crunch or big rip is more than 50 Gyr away for a broader class of models allowing such cataclysmic events. We discuss popular pitfalls and hidden priors.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
Chaotic scalar fields as models for dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.69.123515	We consider stochastically quantized self-interacting scalar fields as suitable models to generate dark energy in the Universe. Second quantization effects lead to new and unexpected phenomena if the self-interaction strength is strong. The stochastically quantized dynamics can degenerate to a chaotic dynamics conjugated to a Bernoulli shift in fictitious time, and the right amount of vacuum energy density can be generated without fine-tuning. It is numerically observed that the scalar field dynamics distinguishes fundamental parameters such as the electroweak and strong coupling constants as corresponding to local minima in the dark energy landscape. Chaotic fields can offer possible solutions to the cosmological coincidence problem, as well as to the problem of uniqueness of vacua.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Exponential potentials for tracker fields	10.1103/PhysRevD.69.103510	We show that a general, exact cosmological solution, where the dynamics of a scalar field is assigned by an exponential potential, satisfies all the issues of the dark energy approach, both from a theoretical point of view and in comparison with available observational data. Moreover, tracking conditions are discussed, with a new treatment of the well known condition Gamma>1. We prove that the currently used expression for Gamma is wrong.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Stability issues for dark energy	10.1142/S0217732304013866	Cosmological data reveal a dark energy with a negative equation of state w = P/rho < 0. We discuss its stability under nucleation from Lambda > 0 to Lambda = 0 in an assumed first-order phase transition. From arguments about stimulated nucleation it is shown that the critical nucleation radius must be at least of galactic size. The spontaneous nucleation rate is infinitesimal thus explaining the dark energy's extreme stability. Dark energy detection at subgalactic scales will never be possible.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Palatini formulation of modified gravity with 1n R terms	10.1016/j.physletb.2004.01.052	Recently, corrections to the standard Einstein-Hilbert action are proposed to explain the current cosmic acceleration instead of introducing dark energy. We discuss the Palatini formulation of the modified gravity with a In R term suggested by Nojiri and Odintsov. We show that in the Palatini formulation, the In R gravity can drive a current exponential accelerated expansion and it reduces to the standard Friedmann evolution for high redshift region. We also discuss the equivalent scalar-tensor formulation of the theory. We indicate that the In R gravity may still have a conflict with electron-electron scattering experiment which stimulates us to pursue a more fundamental theory which can give the In R gravity as an effective theory. Finally, we discuss a problem faced with the extension of the In R gravity by adding R-m terms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Alternative dark energy models: An overview	10.1590/S0103-97332004000200009	A large number of recent observational data strongly suggest that we live in a flat, accelerating Universe composed of similar to 1/3 of matter (baryonic + dark) and similar to 2/3 of an exotic component with large negative pressure, usually named Dark Energy or Quintessence. The basic set of experiments includes: observations from SNe la, CMB anisotropies, large scale structure, X-ray data from galaxy clusters, age estimates of globular clusters and old high redshift galaxies (OHRG's). It is now widely believed that such results provide the remaining piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction (Omega(T) = 1) with astronomical observations. From a theoretical viewpoint, they have also stimulated the current interest for more general models containing an extra component describing this unknown dark energy, and simultaneously accounting for the present accelerating stage of the Universe. In this review we present a simplified picture of the main results and discuss briefly some difficulties underlying the emerging dark energy paradigm.	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
Vacuum solutions of the gravitational field equations in the brane world model	10.1103/PhysRevD.69.064020	We consider some classes Of Solutions of the static, spherically symmetric gravitational field equations in the vacuum in the brane world scenario, in which our Universe is a three-brane embedded in a higher dimensional space-time. The vacuum field equations on the brane are reduced to a system of two ordinary differential equations, which describe till the geometric properties of the vacuum as functions of the dark pressure and dark radiation terms (the projections of the Weyl curvature of the bulk, generating nonlocal brane stresses). Several classes of exact solutions of the vacuum gravitational field equations on the brane are derived. In the particular case of a vanishing dark pressure, the integration of the field equations can be reduced to the integration of an Abel type equation. A perturbative procedure, based on the iterative solution of an integral equation, is also developed for this case. Brane vacuums with particular symmetries are investigated by using Lie group techniques. In the case of a static vacuum brane admitting a one-parameter group of conformal motions, the exact solution of the field equations can be found, with the functional form of the dark radiation and pressure terms uniquely fixed by the symmetry. The requirement of the invariance of the field equations with respect to the quasihomologous group of transformations also imposes a unique, linear proportionality relation between the dark energy and dark pressure. A homology theorem for the static, spherically symmetric gravitational field equations in the vacuum on the brane is also proven.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Accelerating universe in a big bounce model	10.1142/S0217732304013088	Recent observations of Type Ia supernovae provide evidence for the acceleration of our universe, which leads to the possibility that the universe is entering an inflationary epoch. We simulate it under a ``big bounce{''} model, which contains a time variable cosmological ``constant{''} that is derived from a higher dimension and manifests itself in 4D spacetime as dark energy. By properly choosing the two arbitrary functions contained in the model, we obtain a simple exact solution in which the evolution of the universe is divided into several stages. Before the big bounce, the universe contracts from a Lambda-dominated vacuum, and after the bounce, the universe expands. In the early time after the bounce, the expansion of the universe is decelerating. In the late time after the bounce, dark energy (i.e. the variable cosmological ``constant{''}) overtakes dark matter and baryons, and the expansion enters an accelerating stage. When time tends to infinity, the contribution of dark energy tends to two thirds of the total energy density of the universe, qualitatively in agreement with observations.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
The very local Hubble flow: Computer simulations of dynamical history	10.1051/0004-6361:20034170	The phenomenon of the very local ( less than or equal to 3 Mpc) Hubble flow is studied on the basis of the data of recent precision observations. A set of computer simulations is performed to trace the trajectories of the flow galaxies back in time to the epoch of the formation of the Local Group. It is found that the ``initial conditions{''} of the flow are drastically different from the linear velocity-distance relation. The simulations enable one also to recognize the major trends of the flow evolution and identify the dynamical role of universal antigravity produced by the cosmic vacuum.	ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Testing the running of the cosmological constant with type la supernovae at high z	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/02/006	Within the quantum field theory context the idea of a `cosmological constant' (CC) evolving with time looks quite natural as it just reflects the change of the vacuum energy with the typical energy of the universe. In a particular frame that we have considered previously, a `running CC' at low energies may arise from generic quantum effects near the Planck scale, M-P, provided there is a smooth decoupling of all massive particles below M-P. In this work we further develop the cosmological consequences of a `running CC' by addressing the accelerated evolution of the universe within that model. The rate of change of the CC stays slow, without fine-tuning, and is comparable to (HMP2)-M-2. It can be described by a single parameter, nu, that can be determined from already planned experiments using SNe Ia at high z. The range of allowed values for nu follows mainly from nucleosynthesis restrictions. Present samples of SNe Ia can not yet distinguish between a `constant' CC or a `running' one. The numerical simulations presented in this work show that SNAP can probe the predicted variation of the CC either ruling out this idea or confirming the evolution hereafter expected.

Radiative constraints on brane quintessence	10.1088/1475-7516/2004/02/010	We investigate the constraints on quintessence arising from both renormalizable and non-renormalizable couplings where the 5D Planck mass is around the TeV scale. The quintessence field vacuum expectation value is typically of the order of the 4D Planck mass, while non-renormalizable operators are expected to be suppressed by the 5D Planck mass. Non-renormalizable operators are therefore important in computing the 4D effective quintessence potential. We then study the quantum corrections to the quintessence potential due to fermion and graviton loops. The tower of Kaluza-Klein modes competes with the TeV-scale cut-off, altering the graviton contribution to the vacuum polarization of quintessence. Nevertheless, we show that, as in four dimensions, the classical potential is stable to such radiative corrections.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Cosmology with interacting dark energy	10.1142/S021773230401285X	The early cosmic inflation, when taken along with the recent observations that the universe is currently dominated by a low density vacuum energy, leads to at least two potential problems which modern cosmology must address. First, there is the old cosmological constant problem, with a new twist: the coincidence problem. Secondly, cosmology still lacks a model to predict the observed current cosmic acceleration and to determine whether or not there is a future exit out of this state (as previously in the inflationary case). This constitutes (what is called here) a dynamical problem. Here a framework is proposed to address these two problems, based on treating the cosmic background vacuum (dark) energy as both dynamical and interacting. The universe behaves as a vacuum-driven cosmic engine which, in search of equilibrium, always back-reacts to vacuum-induced accelerations by increasing its inertia (internal energy) through vacuum energy dissipation. The process couples cosmic vacuum (dark) energy to matter to produce future-directed increasingly comparable amplitudes in these fields by setting up oscillations in the decaying vacuum energy density and corresponding sympathetic ones in the matter fields. By putting bounds on the relative magnitudes of these coupled oscillations the model offers a natural and conceptually simple channel to discuss the coincidence problem, while also suggesting a way, to deal with the dynamical problem. A result with important observational implications is an equation of state w(t) which specifically predicts a variable, quasi-periodic, acceleration for the current universe. This result can be directly tested by future observational techniques such as SNAP.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
Why is the universe accelerating?		The universe appears to be accelerating, but the reason why is a complete mystery. The simplest explanation, a small vacuum energy (cosmological constant), raises three difficult issues: why the vacuum energy is so small, why it is not quite zero, and why it is comparable to the matter density today. I discuss these mysteries, some of their possible resolutions, and some issues confronting future observations.	NEW COSMOLOGY
Dark energy and condensate stars: Casimir energy in the large		Vacuum fluctuations and the Casimir effect are considered in a cosmological setting. It is suggested that the dark energy, which recent observations suggest make up 73\% of our universe, is vacuum energy due to a causal boundary effect at the cosmological horizon. After a discussion of the similarities and differences between material boundaries in flat spacetime and causal horizons in general relativity, a simple model with a purely vacuum energy de Sitter interior and Schwarzschild exterior, separated by a thin boundary layer is outlined. The boundary layer is a quantum transition region which replaces the event horizons of the classical de Sitter and Schwarzschild solutions, through which the vacuum energy changes.

Multi-graviton theory, a latticized dimension and the cosmological constant	10.1088/0264-9381/20/23/001	Beginning with the Pauli-Fierz theory, we construct a model for multi-graviton theory. Couplings between gravitons belonging to nearest-neighbour `theory spaces' lead to a discrete mass spectrum. Our model coincides with the Kaluza-Klein theory whose fifth dimension is latticized. We evaluate one-loop vacuum energy in models with a circular latticized extra dimension as well as with compact continuous dimensions. We find that the vacuum energy can take a positive value, if the dimension of the continuous spacetime is 6, 10, . . . . Moreover, since the amount of vacuum energy can be an arbitrary small value depending on the choice of parameters in the model, our models are useful for explaining the small positive dark energy in the present universe.

A quintessential introduction to dark energy	10.1098/rsta.2003.1288	Most of the energy in the Universe consists of some form of dark energy that is gravitationally self-repulsive and that is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. The possible candidates are a vacuum energy density (or, equivalently, a cosmological constant) and quintessence, a time-evolving, spatially inhomogeneous component with negative pressure. In this review, we focus on quintessence and ideas on how it might solve the cosmic coincidence problem, how it might be distinguished observationally from a cosmological constant, and how it may affect the overall cosmic history of the Universe.

Braneworld models of dark energy	10.1088/1475-7516/2003/11/014	We explore a new class of braneworld models in which the scalar curvature of the (induced) brane metric contributes to the brane action. The scalar curvature term arises generically on account of one-loop effects induced by matter fields residing on the brane. Spatially flat braneworld models can enter into a regime of accelerated expansion at late times. This is true even if the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant are tuned to satisfy the Randall-Sundrum constraint on the brane. Braneworld models admit a wider range of possibilities for dark energy than standard LCDM. In these models the luminosity distance can be both smaller and larger than the luminosity distance in LCDM. Whereas models with d(L) less than or equal to d(L)(LCDM) imply omega = p/rho greater than or equal to -1 and have frequently been discussed in the literature, models with d(L) > d(L)(LCDM) have traditionally been ignored, perhaps because, within the general-relativistic framework, the luminosity distance has this property only if the equation of state of matter is strongly negative (omega < -1). Within the conventional framework, `phantom energy' with omega < -1 is beset with a host of undesirable properties, which makes this model of dark energy unattractive. Braneworld models, on the other hand, have the capacity to endow dark energy with exciting new possibilities (including omega < -1) without suffering from the problems faced by phantom energy. For a subclass of parameter values, braneworld dark energy and the acceleration of the universe are transient phenomena. In these models, the universe, after the current period of acceleration, re-enters the matter-dominated regime so that the deceleration parameter q(t) -> 0.5 when t >> t(0), where t(0) is the present epoch. Such models could help reconcile an accelerating universe with the requirements of string/M-theory.	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
Cosmological constraints in Lambda-CDM and quintessence paradigms with Archeops	10.1016/j.newar.2003.07.024	We review the cosmological constraints put by the current CMB experiment including the recent Archeops data, in the framework of Lambda-CDM and quintessence paradigm. We show that well chosen combinations of constraints from different cosmological observations lead to precise measurements of cosmological parameters. The Universe seems flat with a 70\% contribution of dark energy with an equation of state very close to those of the vacuum. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS
The value of the equation of state of dark energy	10.1016/j.newar.2003.07.004	From recent CMB and Large Scale Structure observations the value of the equation of state of dark energy, assuming it to be constant in time, is constrained to be -1.3 < w < -0.7 at the 95\% confidence level: consistent with dark energy being a classical vacuum term. Here, we describe two novel and independent methods, sensitive to different systematics, that give the same value for w and similar confidence regions. This suggests that systematics are not an issue in current determinations of w. The first method yields a measurement of w that relies on the minimum number of model-dependent parameters; the second method is a non-parametric measurement of the time dependence of w(z). We also present a method to statistically determine the edge of a distribution. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS
Future evolution of cosmic structure in an accelerating universe	10.1086/378043	Current cosmological data indicate that our universe contains a substantial component of dark vacuum energy that is driving the cosmos to accelerate. We examine the immediate and longer term consequences of this dark energy ( assumed here to have a constant density). Using analytic calculations and supporting numerical simulations, we present criteria for test bodies to remain bound to existing structures. We show that collapsed halos become spatially isolated and dynamically relax to a particular density pro. le with logarithmic slope steeper than - 3 at radii beyond r(200). The asymptotic form of the spacetime metric is then specified. We develop this scenario further by determining the effects of the accelerating expansion on the background radiation fields and individual particles. In an appendix, we generalize these results to include quintessence.	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
Wormholes and ringholes in a dark-energy universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.68.084016	The effects that the present accelerating expansion of the Universe has on the size and shape of Lorentzian wormholes and ringholes are considered. It is shown that, quite similarly to how it occurs for inflating wormholes, relative to the initial embedding-space coordinate system, whereas the shape of the considered holes is always preserved with time, their size is driven by the expansion to increase by a factor which is proportional to the scale factor of the Universe. In the case that dark energy is phantom energy, which is not excluded by present constraints on the dark-energy equation of state, that size increase with time becomes quite more remarkable, and a rather speculative scenario is here presented where the big rip can be circumvented by future advanced civilizations by utilizing sufficiently grown up wormholes and ringholes as time machines that shortcut the big-rip singularity.

The asymptotic structure of space-time	10.1142/S021827180300402X	Astronomical observations strongly suggest that our universe is now accelerating and contains a substantial admixture of dark vacuum energy. Using numerical simulations to study this newly consolidated cosmological model (with a constant density of dark energy), we show that astronomical structures freeze out in the near future and that the density profiles of dark matter halos approach the same general form. Every dark matter halo grows asymptotically isolated and thereby becomes the center of its own island universe. Each of these isolated regions of space-time approaches a universal geometry and we calculate the corresponding form of the space-time metric.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D
Constraints on the equation of state of dark energy and the Hubble constant from stellar ages and the cosmic microwave background	10.1086/376595	We place constraints on the redshift-averaged, effective value of the equation of state of dark energy, w, using only the absolute ages of Galactic stars and the observed position of the first peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find w < -0.8 at the 68\% confidence level. If we further consider that w &GE; -1, this finding suggests that within our uncertainties, dark energy is indistinguishable from a classical vacuum energy term. We detect a correlation between the ages of the oldest galaxies and their redshift. This opens up the possibility of measuring w(z) by computing the relative ages of the oldest galaxies in the universe as a function of redshift, dz/dt. We show that this is a realistic possibility by computing dz/dt at z &SIM; 0 from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies and obtain an independent estimate for the Hubble constant, H-0 = 69 +/- 12 km s(-1) Mpc(-1). The small number of galaxies considered at z > 0.2 does not yield, currently, a precise determination of w(z), but shows that the age-redshift relation is consistent with a standard LambdaCDM universe with w = -1.

An accelerating universe and dynamical compactification of extra dimensions	10.1088/0264-9381/20/15/308	We study a (4 + D)-dimensional Kaluza-Klein cosmology with a Robertson-Walker type metric having two scale factors a and R, corresponding to a D-dimensional internal space and four-dimensional universe, respectively. By introducing exotic matter as the spacetime part of the higher dimensional energy-momentum tensor, a four-dimensional decaying cosmological term appears as Lambda similar to R-2, playing the role of an evolving dark energy in the universe. The resulting field equations yield-the exponential solutions for the scale factors. These exponential behaviours may account for the dynamical compactification of extra dimensions and the accelerating expansion of the four-dimensional universe in terms of the Hubble parameter. The acceleration of the universe may be explained by the negative pressure of the exotic matter. it is shown that the rate of compactification of higher dimensions depends on the dimension, D. We then obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and find the general exact solutions in D dimensions. A good correspondence between the classical solutions and the Wheeler-DeWitt solutions in any dimension, D, is obtained.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
A check on the Cardassian expansion model with type-Ia supernovae data		We use the magnitude-redshift relation for the type Ia supernova. data compiled by Riess et al. to analyze the Cardassian expansion scenario. This scenario assumes the universe to be flat, matter dominated, and accelerating, but contains no vacuum contribution. The best fitting model parameters are H-0 = 65.3 kms(-1) Mpc(-1), n = 0.35 and Omega(m) = 0.05. When the highest redshift supernova, SN 1997ck, is excluded, H-0 remains the same, but n becomes 0.20 and Omega(m), 0.15, and the matter density remains unreasonably low. Our result shows that this particular scenario is strongly disfavoured by the SNeIa data.	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
Can the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w be less than-1?	10.1103/PhysRevD.68.023509	Models of dark energy are conveniently characterized by the equation-of-state parameter w=p/rho, where rho is the energy density and p is the pressure. imposing the dominant energy condition, which guarantees stability of the theory, implies that w greater than or equal to -1. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a well-defined model could (perhaps temporarily) have w < -1, and indeed such models have been proposed. We study the stability of dynamical models exhibiting w < -1 by virtue of a negative kinetic term. Although naively unstable, we explore the possibility that these models might be phenomenologically viable if thought of as effective field theories valid only up to a certain momentum cutoff. Under our most optimistic assumptions, we argue that the instability time scale can be greater than the age of the universe, but only if the cutoff is at or below 10(-3) eV. We conclude that it is difficult, although not necessarily impossible, to construct viable models of dark energy with w < -1; observers should keep an open mind, but the burden is on theorists to demonstrate that any proposed new models are not ruled out by rapid vacuum decay.

Cosmological constant, gauge hierarchy, and warped geometry	10.1103/PhysRevD	It is suggested that the mechanism responsible for the resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem within the warped geometry framework can be generalized to provide a new explanation of the extremely tiny vacuum energy density rho(V) suggested by recent observations. We illustrate the mechanism with some 5D examples in which the true vacuum energy is assumed to vanish, and rho(V) is associated with a false vacuum energy such that rho(V)(1/4) similar to -TeV2/M-P1 similar to 10(-3) eV, where M-P1 denotes the reduced Planck mass. We also consider a quintessence-like solution to the dark energy problem.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological parameter estimation in the quintessence paradigm	10.1051/0004-6361:20030511	We present cosmological parameter constraints on flat cosmologies dominated by dark energy using various cosmological data including the recent Archeops angular power spectrum measurements. A likelihood analysis of the existing Cosmic Microwave Background data shows that in the absence of further prior, dark energy is not required. This comes from the fact that degeneracies exist among the various cosmological parameters constrained by the Cosmic Microwave Background. We found that there is a degeneracy in a combination of the Hubble parameter H-0 and of the dark energy equation of state parameter w(Q), but that w(Q) is not correlated with the primordial index n of scalar fluctuations and the baryon content Omega(b)h(2). The preferred primordial index is n = 0.95 +/- 0.05 (68\%) and baryon content Omega(b)h(2) = 0.021 +/- 0.003. Adding constraints on the amplitude of matter fluctuations on small scales, sigma(8), obtained from clusters abundance or weak lensing data may allow degenaracies to be broken, although present-day systematic uncertainties do not allow for firm conclusions as yet. Further addition of the Hubble Space Telescope measurements of the local distance scale and of the high redshift supernovae data allow one to obtain tight constraints. When these constraints are combined we find that the amount of dark energy is 0.7(-0.07)(+0.10) (95\% C. L.) and that its equation of state is very close to those of the vacuum: w(Q) < - 0.75 (> 95\% C. L.). In no case do we find that quintessence is prefered over the classical cosmological constant, although robust data on sigma(8) might rapidly shed light on this important issue.

Cosmological constant - the weight of the vacuum	10.1016/S0370-1573(03)00120-0	Recent cosmological observations suggest the existence of a positive cosmological constant A with the magnitude Lambda(Gh/c(3))approximate to10(-123). This review discusses several aspects of the cosmological constant both from the cosmological (Sections 1-6) and field theoretical (Sections 7-11) perspectives. After a brief introduction to the key issues related to cosmological constant and a historical overview, a summary of the kinematics and dynamics of the standard Friedmann model of the universe is provided. The observational evidence for cosmological constant, especially from the supernova results, and the constraints from the age of the universe, structure formation, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) anisotropies and a few others are described in detail, followed by a discussion of the theoretical models (quintessence, tachyonic scalar field,...) from different perspectives. The latter part of the review (Sections 7-11) concentrates on more conceptual and fundamental aspects of the cosmological constant like some alternative interpretations of the cosmological constant, relaxation mechanisms to reduce the cosmological constant to the currently observed value, the geometrical structure of the de Sitter spacetime, thermodynamics of the de Sitter universe and the role of string theory in the cosmological constant problem.

Unified model for dark energy	10.1016/S0370-2693(03)00540-9	New models for the universe filled with generalized Chaplygin fluids are considered which unitarily describe as a single vacuum entity either both a quintessence scalar field and a cosmological constant, or dark matter and dark energy, so respectively unifying the notion of dark energy and that of all dark components. While the evolution of the universe filled with such fluids does not obviously contradict the present cosmic acceleration, the introduced single dark-energy and dark-matter components, for equations of state with characteristic parameter omega greater than or equal to -1, behaves like either an usual quintessence fluid with constant equation of state or pure dark matter, at early high densities, and, in any case, like a pure cosmological constant at late cosmological times.

Anthropic approach to the cosmological constant problems		There are now two cosmological constant problems: (i) why the vacuum energy is so small and (ii) why it comes to dominate at about the epoch of galaxy formation. Anthropic selection appears to be the only approach that can naturally resolve both problems. Here I review this approach, emphasizing the testable predictions that it makes for the dark energy density and for its equation of state.	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS
Ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, cosmological constant, and theta vacua	10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.191301	We propose that the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff and the origin of small cosmological constant can both be explained by vacuum tunneling effects in a theory with degenerate vacua and fermionic doublets. By considering the possibility of tunneling from a particular winding number state, accompanied by violation of some global quantum number of fermions, the small value of the vacuum dark energy and the production of high energy cosmic rays are shown to be related. We predict that the energy of such cosmic rays should be at least 5x10(14) GeV.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
Trans-Planckian dark energy?	10.1103/PhysRevD.67.103520	It has recently been proposed by Bastero-Gil, Mersini and co-workers that dark energy could be attributed to the cosmological properties of a scalar field with a nonstandard dispersion relation that decreases exponentially at wave numbers larger than the Planck scale (k(phys)>M-Pl). In this scenario, the energy density stored in the modes of trans-Planckian wave numbers but sub-Hubble frequencies produced by amplification of the vacuum quantum fluctuations would account naturally for the dark energy. The present paper examines this model in detail and shows step by step that it does not work. In particular, we show that this model cannot make definite predictions since there is no well-defined vacuum state in the region of wave numbers considered: hence, the initial data cannot be specified unambiguously. We also show that for most choices of initial data this scenario implies the production of a large amount of energy density (of order similar toM(Pl)(4)) for modes with momenta similar toM(Pl), far in excess of the background energy density. We evaluate the amount of fine tuning in the initial data necessary to avoid this back-reaction problem and find it is of order H/M-Pl. We also argue that the equation of state of the trans-Planckian modes is not vacuumlike. Therefore this model does not provide a suitable explanation for the dark energy.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark matter, dark energy, gravitational lensing and the formation of structure in the universe	10.1088/0034-4885/66/5/201	The large-scale structure of the universe and its statistical-properties can reveal many aspects of the physics of the early universe as well as of its matter. content during the cosmic history. Numerous observations, based to a large extent on large scale structure data, have given us a concordant picture of the energy and matter content in the universe.. In view of these results the existence of dark matter has been firmly established although it still evades attempts at direct detection. An even more challenging puzzle is, however, yet to be explained. Indeed the model suggested-by the observations is only viable with the presence of a `dark energy', an ethereal energy associated with the cosmological vacuum, that would represent about two-thirds of the total energy density of the universe. Although strongly indicated by observations, the existence of this component is nonetheless very uncomfortable from a high-energy physics point of view. Its interpretation is a matter of far reaching debates. Indeed, the phenomenological manifestation of this component can be viewed as a geometrical property of large-scale gravity, or as the energy associated with the quantum field vacuum, or else as the manifestation of a new sort of cosmic fluid that would fill space and remain unclustered. Low redshift detailed examinations of the geometrical or clustering properties of the universe should in all cases.' help clarify the true nature of the dark energy. We present methods that can be used in the future for exploring the low, redshift physical properties of the universe. Particular emphasis will be placed on the use of large-scale structure surveys and more specifically on weak lensing surveys that promise to be extremely powerful in exploring the large-scale mass,distribution in the universe.

Cosmological implications of APM 08279+5255, an old quasar at z=3.91	10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06553.x	The existence of old high-redshift objects provides an important tool for constraining the expanding age of the Universe and the formation epoch of the first objects. In a recent paper, Hasinger, Schartel & Komossa reported the discovery of the quasar APM 08279 + 5255 at redshift z=3.91 with an extremely high iron abundance, and estimated age of 2-3 Gyr. By assuming the lower limit for this age estimate and the latest measurements of the Hubble parameter as given by the HST key project, we study some cosmological implications from the existence of this object. In particular, we derive new limits on the dark matter and vacuum energy contribution. Our analysis is also extended to quintessence scenarios in which the dark energy is parametrized by a smooth component with an equation of state p(x)=omega(x)rho(x) (-1less than or equal toomega(x)<0). For flat models with a relic cosmological constant we show that the vacuum energy density parameter is constrained to be Omega(Lambda)greater than or equal to0.78, a result that is marginally compatible with recent observations from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and cosmic microwave background (CMB). For quintessence scenarios the same analysis restricts the cosmic parameter to omega(x)less than or equal to-0.22. Limits on a possible first epoch of quasar formation are also briefly discussed. The existence of this object pushes the formation era back to extremely high redshifts.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
A model of dark energy for the accelerating universe	10.1023/A:1022970219502	Recent observations of large scale structure of the Universe, especially that of Type Ia supernovae, indicate that the Universe is flat and is accelerating, and that the dominant energy density in the Universe is the cosmic dark energy. We propose a model in which the cosmic effective Yang-Mills condensate familiar in particle physics plays the role of the dark energy that causes the acceleration of the Universe. Since the quantum effective Yang-Mills field in certain states has the equation of state p(y) = -rho(y), when employed as the cosmic matter source, it naturally results in an accelerating expansion of the Universe. With the matter components (Omega(M) similar to 1/3) being added into the model, the composition of YM condensate and matter components can give rise to the desired equation of state w similar to -2/3 for the Universe.	GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION
Quintessence and-the underlying particle physics theory	10.1016/S0370-2693(03)00099-6	At present we know nothing about the nature of the dark energy accounting for about 70\% of the energy density of the universe. One possibility is that the dark energy is provided by an extremely light field, the quintessence, rolling down its potential. Even though the underlying particle theory responsible for the present quintessential behaviour of our universe is unknown, such a theory is likely to have contact with supersymmetry, supergravity or (super)string theory. In these theories, there are plenty of scalar fields (moduli) which are gravitationally coupled to all the other degrees of freedom and have vacuum expectation values of the order of the Planck scale. We point out that, in theories which allow a consistent embedding of quintessence, the generic gravitational interaction of the moduli fields with the quintessence field gives rise to a contribution to the energy density from the moduli fields of the order of the critical energy density of the universe today. Furthermore, the interaction contribution can generically enhance the negativity of the equation of state. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.	PHYSICS LETTERS B
Current and future supernova constraints on decaying Lambda cosmologies	10.1103/PhysRevD.67.043502	We investigate observational constraints from present and future supernova data on a large class of decaying vacuum cosmologies. In such scenarios the present value of the vacuum energy density is quantified by a positive beta parameter smaller than unity. By assuming a Gaussian prior on the matter density parameter (Omega(m)=0.35+/-0.07) we find Omega(m)=0.34(-0.12)(+0.14) and beta=0.62(-0.24)(+0.12) (95\% C.L.) as the best fit values for the present data. We show that, while the current data cannot provide restrictive constraints on the Omega(m)-beta plane, the future SNe data will limit considerably the allowed parameter space. A brief discussion about the equivalence between dynamical Lambda scenarios and scalar field cosmologies is also included.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Cosmological consequences of a Chaplygin gas dark energy	10.1103/PhysRevD.67.023515	A combination of recent observational results has given rise to what is currently known as the dark energy problem. Although several possible candidates have been extensively discussed in the literature, the nature of this dark energy component is not well understood at present. In this paper we investigate some cosmological implications of another dark energy candidate: an exotic fluid known as the Chaplygin gas, which is characterized by an equation of state p= -A/rho, where A is a positive constant. By assuming a flat scenario driven by nonrelativistic matter plus a Chaplygin gas dark energy we study the influence of such a component on the statistical properties of gravitational lenses. A comparison between the predicted age of the universe and the latest age estimates of globular clusters is also included and the results briefly discussed. In general, we find that the behavior of this class of models may be interpreted as an intermediary case between the standard model and the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant scenarios.

Dark energy present and future		By studying the present cosmological data, particularly on CMB, SNeIA and LSS, we find that the future fate of the universe, for simple linear models of the dark energy equation-of-state, can vary between the extremes of (I) a divergence of the scale factor in as little as 7 Gyr; (II) an infinite lifetime of the universe with dark energy dominant for all future time; (III) a disappearing dark energy where the universe asymptotes as t --> infinity to a(t) similar to t(2/3) i.e. matter domination. Precision cosmological data hint that a dark energy with equation of state w = P/rho < - 1 and hence dubious stability is viable. Here we discuss for any w nucleation from Lambda > 0 to Lambda = 0 in a first-order phase transition. The critical radius is argued to be at least of galactic size and the corresponding nucleation rate glacial, thus underwriting the dark energy's stability and rendering remote any microscopic effect.

The measurements of magnitude vs redshift of very distant type la supernovae indicate that the expansion rate of the universe is increasing. This acceleration requires the existence of a Dark Energy that overcomes the gravitational self-attraction of matter, such as the vacuum energy density associated with the cosmological constant (A).

Dark radiation dynamics on the brane	10.1103/PhysRevD.66.124002	We investigate the dynamics of a spherically symmetric vacuum on a Randall and Sundrum 3-brane world. Under certain natural conditions, the effective Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system for spherically symmetric dark radiation. We determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions, which are shown to depend on the brane cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge and on its initial energy configuration. We identify the conditions defining these solutions as singular or as globally regular. Finally, we discuss the confinement of gravity to the vicinity of the brane and show that a phase transition to a regime where gravity is not bound to the brane may occur at short distances during the collapse of positive dark energy density on a realistic de Sitter brane.

Vacuum selection by inflation as the origin of the dark energy	10.1142/S0218271802002967	I propose a new mechanism to account for the observed tiny but finite dark energy in terms of a non-Abelian Higgs theory, which has infinitely many perturbative vacua characterized by a winding number, in the framework of inflationary cosmology. Inflation homogenizes field configuration and practically realizes a perturbative vacuum with vanishing winding number, which is expressed by a superposition of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with different vacuum energy density. As a result, we naturally find a non-vanishing vacuum energy density with fairly large probability, under the assumption that the cosmological constant vanishes in some vacuum state. Since the predicted magnitude of dark energy is exponentially suppressed by the instanton action, we can fit observation without introducing any tiny parameters.

Satellite Eotvos test of the weak equivalence principle for zero-point vacuum energy	10.1088/1367-2630/4/1/392	An Eotvos experiment to test the weak equivalence principle (WEP) for zero-point vacuum energy is proposed using a satellite. Following the suggestion of Ross for a terrestrial experiment of this type, the acceleration of a spherical test mass of aluminium would be compared with that of a similar test mass made from another material. The estimated ratio of the zero-point vacuum energy density inside the aluminium sphere to the rest mass energy density is similar to 1.6 x 10(-14), which would allow a 1\% resolution of a potential WEP violation observed in a satellite mission test that had a baseline sensitivity to WEP violations of similar to10(-16). An observed violation of the WEP for vacuum energy density would constitute a significant clue as to the origin of the cosmological constant and the source of dark energy, and test a recently proposed resolution of the cosmological constant problem, based on a model of nonlocal quantum gravity and quantum field theory.

A late-time transition in the cosmic dark energy?	10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05887.x	We study constraints from the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB), large-scale structure (2dF, Abell/ACO, PSCz) and SN1a data on dark energy models with a sharp transition in their equation of state, w(z). Such a transition is motivated by models like vacuum metamorphosis where non-perturbative quantum effects are important at late times. We allow the transition to occur at a specific redshift, z(t), to a final negative pressure-1 less than or equal to w(f) < -1/3. We find that the CMB and supernovae data, in particular, prefer a late-time transition because of the associated delay in cosmic acceleration. The best fits (+/-1&sigma; errors) to all the data are z(t) = 2.0(-0.76)(+2.2), Omega(Q) = 0.73(-0.04)(+0.02) and w(f) = -1+0.2. For z(t) > 5 the likelihood becomes flat, asymptoting to the standard LambdaCDM model.	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
Neutrinos in a vacuum dominated cosmology	10.1023/A:1020768125199	We explore the dynamics of neutrinos in a vacuum dominated cosmology. First we show that such a geometry will induce a phase change in the eigenstates of a massive neutrino and we calculate the phase change. We also calculate the delay in the neutrino flight times in this geometry. Applying our results to the presently observed background vacuum energy density, we find that for neutrino sources further than 1:5 Gpc away both effects become non-trivial, being of the order of the standard relativistic corrections. Such sources are within the observable Hubble Deep Field. The results which are theoretically interesting are also potentially useful, in the future, as detection techniques improve. For example such effects on neutrinos from distant sources like supernovae could be used, in an independent method alternative to standard candles, to constrain the dark energy density and the deceleration parameter. The discussion is extended to investigate Caianiello's inertial or maximal acceleration (MA) effects of such a vacuum dominated spacetime on neutrino oscillations. Assuming that the MA phenomenon exists, we find that its form as generated by the presently observed vacuum energy density would still have little or no measurable effect on neutrino phase evolution, for neutrinos in the energy range of a few eV.

Is the universe inflating? Dark energy and the future of the universe	10.1103/PhysRevD.66.043511	We consider the fate of the observable universe in the light of the discovery of a dark energy component to the cosmic energy budget. We extend results for a cosmological constant to a general dark energy component and examine the constraints on phenomena that may prevent the eternal acceleration of our patch of the universe. We find that the period of accelerated cosmic expansion has not lasted long enough for observations to confirm that we are undergoing inflation; such an observation will be possible when the dark energy density has risen to between 90\% and 95\% of the critical. The best we can do is make cosmological observations in order to verify the continued presence of dark energy to some high redshift. Having done that, the only possibility that could spoil the conclusion that we are inflating would be the existence of a disturbance (the surface of a true vacuum bubble, for example) that is moving toward us with sufficiently high velocity, but is too far away to be currently observable. Such a disturbance would have to move toward us with speed greater than about 0.8c in order to spoil the late-time inflation of our patch of the universe and yet avoid being detectable.

Deflationary cosmology: Constraints from angular size and ages of globular clusters	10.1103/PhysRevD.66.023520	Observational constraints to a large class of decaying vacuum cosmologies are derived using the angular size data of compact radio sources and the latest age estimates of globular clusters. For this class of deflationary Lambda(t) models, the present value of the vacuum energy density is quantified by a positive beta parameter smaller than unity. In the case of milliarcsecond compact radio-sources, we find that the allowed intervals for beta and the matter density parameter Omega(m) are heavily dependent on the value of the mean projected linear size l. For lsimilar or equal to20h(-1)-30h(-1) pc, the best fit occurs for betasimilar to0.58, Omega(m)similar to0.58, and betasimilar to0.76, Omega(m)similar to0.28, respectively. This analysis shows that if one minimizes chi(2) for the free parameters l, Omega(m) and beta, the best fit for these angular size data corresponds to a decaying Lambda(t) with Omega(m)=0.54, beta=0.6, and l=22.64h(-1) pc. Constraints from age estimates of globular clusters and old high redshift galaxies are not so restrictive, thereby suggesting that there is no age crisis for this kind of Lambda(t) cosmologies.

The cosmological constant problem and quintessence	10.1088/0264-9381/19/13/304	I briefly review the cosmological constant problem and the issue of dark energy (or quintessence). Within the framework of quantum field theory, the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor formally diverges as k(4). A cutoff at the Planck or electroweak scale leads to a cosmological constant which is, respectively, 10(123) or 10(55) times larger than the observed value, Lambda/8piG similar or equal to 10(-47) GeV4. The absence of a fundamental symmetry which could set the value of A to either zero or a very small value leads to the cosmological constant problem. Most cosmological scenarios favour a large time-dependent Lambda-term in the past (in order to generate inflation at z much greater than 10(10)), and a small Lambda-term today, to account for the current acceleration of the universe at z less than or similar to 1. Constraints arising from cosmological nucleosynthesis, CMB and structure formation constrain A to be sub-dominant during most of the intermediate epoch 10(10) < z < 1. This leads to the cosmic coincidence conundrum which suggests that the acceleration of the universe is a recent phenomenon and that we live during a special epoch when the density in A and in matter are almost equal. Time varying models of dark energy can, to a certain extent, ameliorate the fine-tuning problem (faced by Lambda), but do not resolve the puzzle of cosmic coincidence. I briefly review tracker models of dark energy, as well as more recent brane inspired ideas and the issue of horizons in an accelerating universe. Model independent methods which reconstruct the cosmic equation of state from supernova observations are also assessed. Finally, a new diagnostic of dark energy-statefinder-is discussed.	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY
Some observational consequences of brane world cosmologies	10.1103/PhysRevD.65.123514	The presence of dark energy in the Universe is inferred directly and indirectly from a large body of observational evidence. The simplest and most theoretically appealing possibility is the vacuum energy density (cosmological constant). However, although in agreement with current observations, such a possibility exacerbates the well known cosmological constant problem, requiring a natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we focus our attention on another dark energy candidate, one arising from gravitational leakage into extra dimensions. We investigate observational constraints from current measurements of the angular size of high-z compact radio sources on accelerated models based on this large scale modification of gravity. The predicted age of the Universe in the context of these models is briefly discussed. We argue that future observations will enable a more accurate test of these cosmologies and, possibly, show that such models constitute a viable possibility for the dark energy problem.

Measurement of the cosmological constant		The type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) provided the first direct indication of a non zero cosmological constant (Lambda). After an introduction of the scientific context, the status of the cosmological constant measurement will be reviewed. The usage of SN Ia to probe the vacuum energy and more generally to study the dark energy seems quite promising. In a close future SN Ia should provide precise and well controlled measurements. The program ``nearby SuperNova Factory{''} (SNFactory), centered on detailed studies of similar to400 nearby SN Ia, and the proposal ``SuperNova Accelerating Probe satellite{''} (SNAP), which should be a break through in the study of the acceleration of the Universe expension, will be introduced.

Modified dispersion relations from closed strings in toroidal cosmology	10.1103/PhysRevD.65.106002	A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally small value of the cosmological constant Lambdasimilar to10(-120) measured in natural Planckian units. Here we suggest how this tiny number might arise from a toroidal string cosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy would arise from a correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances has an exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta. The freeze-out by the expansion of the background universe for these trans-Planckian modes might be interpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the three noncompactified spatial dimensions. Our qualitative arguments are heuristic in nature and published only because they may suggest an improved treatment of the connection between strings and cosmological expansion.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Scalar field description of decaying-Lambda cosmologies	10.1103/PhysRevD.65.083513	The conditions under which cosmologies driven by time-varying cosmological terms can be described by a scalar field coupled to a perfect fluid are discussed. An algorithm to reconstruct potentials dynamically and thermodynamically analogous to given phenomenological Lambda models is presented. As a working example, the deflationary cosmology which evolves from a pure de Sitter vacuum state to a slightly modified Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology is considered. It is found that this is an example of nonsingular warm inflation with an asymptotic exponential potential. Differences with respect to other scalar field descriptions of decaying vacuum cosmologies are addressed and possible extensions are indicated.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Vacuum decay constraints on a cosmological scalar field	10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.121302	If the potential of a scalar filed phi which currently provides the dark energy of the Universe has a minimum at phi = -M-0(4) < 0, then quantum-mechanical fluctuations could nucleate a bubble of &phi; at a negative value of the potential. This bubble would then expand at the speed of light. Given that no such bubble enveloped us in the past, we find that any minimum in V(&phi;) must be separated from the current &phi; value by more than min\{1.5M(&ODOT;), 0.21M(P1)\} where M-P1 is the Planck mass. We also show that vacuum decay renders a cyclic or ekpyrotic universe with M-0(4) greater than or similar to 10(-10) M-P1(4) untenable.	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
Natural magnetogenesis from inflation	10.1103/PhysRevD.65.063505	We consider the gravitational generation of the massive Z boson field of the standard model, due to the natural breaking of its conformal invariance during inflation. The electroweak symmetry restoration at the end of inflation turns the almost scale-invariant superhorizon Z spectrum into a hypermagnetic field, which transforms into a regular magnetic field at the electroweak phase transition. The mechanism is generic and is shown to generate a superhorizon spectrum of the form B proportional to 1/ l on a length scale l regardless of the choice of the inflationary model. Scaled to the epoch of galaxy formation such a field suffices to trigger the galactic dynamo and explain the observed galactic magnetic fields in the case of a spatially flat, dark energy dominated universe with grand-unified-theory-scale inflation. The possibility of further amplification of the generated field by preheating is also investigated. To this end we study a model of supersymmetric hybrid inflation with a flipped SU(5) grand unified symmetry group.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy and the angular size - Redshift diagram for milliarcsecond radio sources	10.1086/337986	We investigate observational constraints on the cosmic equation of state from measurements of angular size for a large sample of milliarcsecond compact radio sources. The results are based on a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model driven by nonrelativistic matter, plus a smooth, dark energy component parameterized by its equation of state p(x) = omegarho(x) (-1 less than or equal to omega < 0). The allowed intervals for &omega; and &UOmega;(m) are heavily dependent on the value of the mean projected linear size l. For l &SIME; 20-30 h(-1) pc, we find &UOmega;(m) &LE; 0.62, &omega; &LE; -0.2, and &UOmega;(m) &LE; 0.17, &omega; &LE; -0.65 (68\% c.l.), respectively. As a general result, this analysis shows that if one minimizes &chi;(2) for the parameters l, &UOmega;m, and &omega;, the conventional &ULambda;CDM model (&omega; = -1) with &UOmega;(m) = 0.2, and l = 22.6h(-1) pc is the best fit for these angular size data.

Supernova type Ia data and the cosmic microwave background of modified curvature at short and large distances	10.1103/PhysRevD.65.023502	The SNIa data, although inconclusive, when combined with other observations makes a strong case that our universe is presently dominated by dark energy. We investigate the possibility that large distance modifications of the curvature of the universe would perhaps offer an alternative explanation of the observation. Our calculations indicate that a universe made up of no dark energy but instead, with a modified curvature at large scales, is not scale invariant therefore quite likely it is ruled out by the CMB observations, The sensitivity of the CMB spectrum is checked for the whole range of mode modifications of large or short distance physics. The spectrum is robust against modifications of short-distance physics and the UV cutoff when the initial state is the adiabatic vacuum, and the inflationary background space is de Sitter space.

Dark energy from strings		A long-standing problem of theoretical physics is the exceptionally small value of the cosmological constant A similar to 10(-120) measured in natural Planckian units. Here we derive this tiny number from a toroidal string cosmology based on closed strings. In this picture the dark energy arises from the correlation between momentum and winding modes that for short distances has an exponential fall-off with increasing values of the momenta. The freeze-out by the expansion of the background universe for these transplanckian modes may be interpreted as a frozen condensate of the closed-string modes in the three non-compactified spatial dimensions.	COSMOLOGY AND ELEMENTARY PARTICLE PHYSICS
Considerations on accelerated expansion in a scalar-tensor cosmology		An accelerated, or at least a non-decelerating one, expansion in scalar-tensor theories for isotropic models in the presence of barotropic fluids only, without the aid of quintessence matter is possible because of the given, natural properties, that the postulated scalar fields have. So the addition of matter fields minimally coupled to gravity with the sole purpose of speeding up its expansion may be superfluous. These special field characteristics can be more clearly examined when the scalar is sourceless. To this end it is therefore fundamental, and fortunately, possible to exhibit all the analytic solutions for at least the simplest scalar-tensor theory, the Brans-Dicke cosmology with a sourceless scalar.

Cosmological constant, false vacua, and axions	10.1103/PhysRevD.64.123513	It is suggested that the true ground state of the world has exactly vanishing vacuum energy and that the cosmological constant that seems to have been observed is due to our region of the universe being stuck in a false vacuum, whose energy is split from the true vacuum by nonrenormalizable operators that are suppressed by powers of the Planck scale. It is shown that conventional invisible axion models typically have the features needed to realize this possibility. In invisible axion models the same field and the same potential can explain both the cosmological constant (or dark energy) and the dark matter. It is also shown that the idea can be realized in nonaxion models, an example of which is given having Lambda =M-W(7)/M-P1(3), which agrees well with the observed value.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
Dark energy in perturbative string cosmology		The apparent observation of dark energy poses problems for string theory. In de Sitter space, or in quintessence models, one cannot define a gauge-invariant S-matrix. We argue that eternal quintessence does not arise in weakly coupled string theory, but point out that it is difficult to define an S-matrix even in the presence of perturbative potentials for the moduli. The solutions of the Fischler-Susskind equations all have Big Bang or Big Crunch Singularities. We believe that an S-matrix (or S-vector) exists in this context but cannot be calculated by purely perturbative methods. We study the possibility of metastable de Sitter vacua in such weakly coupled scenarios, and conclude that the S-matrix of the extreme weak coupling region cannot probe de Sitter physics. We also consider proposed explanations of the dark energy from the perspective of string theory, and find that most are implausible. We note that it is possible that the axion constitutes both the dark matter and the dark energy.	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Cosmic antifriction and accelerated expansion	10.1103/PhysRevD.64.063501	We explain an accelerated expansion of the present Universe, suggested from observations of supernovae of type la at high redshift, by introducing an antifrictional force that is self-consistently exerted on the particles of the cosmic substratum. Cosmic antifriction. which is intimately related to ``particle production,{''} is shown to give rise to an effective negative pressure of the cosmic medium. While other explanations for an accelerated expansion (cosmological constant, quintessence) introduce a component of dark energy in addition to ``standard{''} cold dark matter (CDM) we resort to a phenomenological one-component model of CDM with internal self-interactions. We demonstrate how the dynamics of the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant may be recovered as a special case of cosmic antifriction. We discuss the connection with two-component models and obtain an attractor behavior for the ratio of the energy densities of both components which provides a possible phenomenological solution to the coincidence problem.

Relic dark energy from the trans-Planckian regime	10.1103/PhysRevD.64.043508	As yet, there is no underlying fundamental theory for the trans-Planckian regime. There is a need to address the issue of how the observables in our present Universe are affected by processes that may have occurred at super-Planckian energies (referred to as the trans-Planckian regime). Specifically, we focus on the impact the trans-Planckian regime has on two observables: namely, dark energy and the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) spectrum. We model the trans-Planckian regime by introducing a I-parameter family of smooth non-linear dispersion relations which modify the frequencies at very short distances. A particular feature of the family of dispersion functions chosen is the production of ultralow frequencies at very high momenta k (for k>M-p). We name the range of the ultralow energy modes (of very short distances) that have frequencies equal to or less than the current Hubble rate Ho as the tail modes. These modes are still frozen today due to the expansion of the Universe. We calculate their energy today and show that the tail provides a strong candidate for the dark energy of the Universe. During inflation, their energy is about 122 to 123 orders of magnitude smaller than the total energy, for any random value of the free parameter in the family of dispersion relations. For this family of dispersions, we present the exact solutions and show that the CMBR spectrum is that of a (nearly) blackbody, and that the adiabatic vacuum is the only choice for the initial conditions.

Self-tuning dark energy in brane world cosmology	10.1142/S0217732301004273	In this letter, the self-tuning mechanism of dark energy is proposed by considering the cosmological matter in the brane world. In the first part of this letter, the effective four-dimensional Friedmann equation in the presence of the bulk scalar field is derived. In our model, the bulk scalar field takes the role of the dark energy and its value is slowly varying in time. The claim is that, even if the enormous amount of vacuum energy exists on the brane, the present value of the dark energy is self-tuned to be consistent with the current observations. This result will open the possibility to discuss the dark energy in the brane world in the context of the anthropic principle or quantum cosmology.	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS A
The cosmic microwave background for a nearly flat compact hyperbolic universe	10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04304.x	The fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are investigated for a hyperbolic universe with finite volume. Four-component models with radiation, matter, vacuum energy and an extra spatially constant dark energy X-component are considered. The general solution of the Friedmann equation for the cosmic scalefactor a(eta) is given for the four-component models in terms of the Weierstrass P-function. The lower parts of the angular power spectra C-l of the CMB anisotropy are computed for nearly flat models with Omega (tot) less than or equal to 0.95. It is shown that the particular compact fundamental cell that is considered in this paper leads to a suppression in C-l for l less than or similar to 10 and Omega (tot) less than or similar to 0.9.

Measuring time dependence of dark energy density from type Ia supernova data	10.1086/320552	Observations of high-redshift supernovae imply an accelerating universe that can only be explained by an unusual energy component such as vacuum energy or quintessence. To assess the ability of current and future supernova data to constrain the properties of the dark energy, we allow its density to have arbitrary time dependence, rho (x)(z). This leads to an equation of state for the dark energy, w(x)(z) = p(x)(z)rho (x)(z), which is a free function of redshift z. We find that current data of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are consistent with a cosmological constant, with large uncertainties at z greater than or similar to 0.5. We show that rho (x)(z)/rho (x)(z = 0) can be measured reasonably well to about z = 1.5 using SN Ia data from realistic future SN Ia pencil beam surveys, provided that the weak energy condition (energy density of matter is nonnegative for any observer) is imposed. While it is only possible to differentiate between different models (say, quintessence and k-essence) at z less than or similar to 1.5 using realistic data, the correct trend in the time dependence of the dark energy density can be clearly detected out to z = 2, even in the presence of plausible systematic effects. This would allow us to determine whether the dark energy is a cosmological constant or some exotic form of energy with a time-dependent density.	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
Dark matter and energy of universe		We describe the different components of the present energy of the universe starting from the well established radiation and luminous matter, following with the dark baryonic matter determined by primordial nucleosynthesis, the likely cold dark matter with its theoretical candidates, the sure but not yet defined hot dark matter represented by neutrinos and the evidence of dark energy given by cosmological constant, vacuum energy or quintessence.	PARTICLES AND FIELDS
The quintessential universe		Recent evidence suggests that most of the energy in the universe consists of some form of dark energy that is gravitationally self-repulsive and that is causing the expansion rate of the universe to accelerate. We review the evidence, including recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the DASI, BOOMerang and MAXIMA groups. The dark energy may consist of vacuum energy density (or, equivalently, a cosmological constant), or quintessence, a time-evolving, spatially inhomogeneous component with negative pressure. A key problem is to explain the initial conditions required to have the energy density nearly coincident with the matter density today. A possible solution is ``k-essence,{''} a form of quintessence with an attractor-like solution which leads to cosmic acceleration today for a very wide range of initial conditions without fine-tuning and without invoking an anthropic argument.

THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ELEMENTARY ASPECTS OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
Tracking extended quintessence	10.1103/PhysRevD.62.123510	We investigate the cosmological role of a tracking field phi in extended quintessence scenarios, where the dynamical vacuum energy driving the acceleration of the universe today possesses an explicit coupling with the Ricci scalar R of the form F(phi )R/2, where F(phi) mimics general relativity today, F(phi (o)) = 1/8 piG. We analyze explicit nonminimally coupled (NMC) models where F(phi) = 1/8 piG+ xi(phi (2)-phi (2)(o)). with xi is the coupling constant and phi (o) is the Q value today. Tracker solutions for these NMC models, with inverse power-law potentials, possess an initial enhancement of the scalar field dynamics, named the R-boost, caused by the effective potential generated by the Ricci scalar in the Klein-Gordon equation. During this phase the held performs a ``gravitational'' slow rolling until the true potential becomes important. We give accurate analytic formulas describing the R-boost, showing that the quintessence energy in this phase scales with the redshift: as (1+z)(2). When the R-boost ends, the field trajectory matches the tracker solution in minimally coupled theories. We compute perturbations in these tracking extended quintessence models, by integrating the full set of equations for the evolution of linear fluctuations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity, and assuming Gaussian scale-invariant initial perturbations. The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular spectrum causes a change deltaC(l)/C-l similar or equal to 6[1 - 8 pi GF(phi (dec))] at l less than or similar to 10, where ``dec'' stands for decoupling. Similarly, the CMB acoustic peak multipoles shift compared to ordinary tracking quintessence models by roughly an amount deltal/l similar or equal to [8 pi GF(phi (dec))- 1]/8. The turnover wave number k(turn) in the matter power spectrum shifts by an amount deltak(turn)/k(turn)similar or equal to [1-8 pi GF(phi (eq))]/2, where ``eq{''} stands for matter-radiation equivalence. All these corrections may assume positive as well as negative values, depending on the sign of the NMC parameter xi. We show that the above effects can be as large as 10-30\% with respect to equivalent cosmological constant and ordinary tracking quintessence models, respecting all the existing experimental constraints on scalar-tensor theories of gravity. These results demonstrate that the playground where the data of the next decade will have their impact includes the nature of the dark energy in the Universe, as well as the structure of the theory of gravity.

Dark matter and the origin of mass: A simplified semiclassical approach		The pervasive presence in space of a flux of high-speed, electrically uncharged dark matter particles is examined here for potential consequences. Dark matter interactions with ordinary matter are considered, and a model of the dark matter flux is developed. in this model, the property of matter that we designate as mass is a measure of the interaction cross section of ordinary matter with the flux of dark matter. From this model emerge effects similar to certain quantum phenomena, and also a flux-mediated attractive inverse square force between particles of ordinary matter. The occurrence of effects resembling both quantum and gravitational phenomena in this model may enable a straightforward examination of the convergence of gravitational physics and quantum mechanics.

Geometrodynamics of variable-speed-of-light cosmologies	10.1103/PhysRevD.62.103518	Variable-speed-of-light (VSL) cosmologies are currently attracting interest as an alternative to inflation. We investigate the fundamental geometrodynamic aspects of VSL cosmologies and provide several implementations which do not explicitly break Lorentz invariance (no ``hard'' breaking). These `'soft'' implementations of Lorentz symmetry breaking provide particularly clean answers to the question ``VSL with respect to what?.{''} The class of VSL cosmologies,vr consider are compatible with both classical Einstein gravity and low-energy particle physics. These models solve the ``kinematic{''} puzzles of cosmology as well as inflation does, but cannot by themselves solve the flatness problem, since in their purest form no violation of the strong energy condition occurs. We also consider a heterotic model (VSL plus inflation) which provides a number of observational implications for the low-redshift universe if chi contributes to the `'dark energy{''} either as CDM or quintessence. These implications include modified gravitational lensing, birefringence, variation of fundamental constants and rotation of the plane of polarization of light from distant sources.	PHYSICAL REVIEW D
The dark side of the universe: from Zwicky to accelerated expansion	10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00040-5	More than 60 years ago Zwicky made the case that the great clusters of galaxies are held together by the gravitational force of unseen (dark) matter. Today, the case is stronger and more precise: dark, nonbaryonic matter accounts for 30 +/- 7\% of the critical mass density, with baryons (most of which are dark) contributing only 4.5 +/- 1\% of the critical density. The large-scale structure that exists in the universe indicates that the bulk of the nonbaryonic dark matter must be cold (slowly moving particles). The SuperKamiokande detection of neutrino oscillations shows that particle dark matter, in the form of massive neutrinos, actually exists and accounts for as much mass as bright stars. An important threshold has been crossed; particle dark matter is no longer hypothetical. Over the past few years a case has developed for dark energy. This dark, relativistic component contributes about 80 +/- 20\% of the critical density and is characterized by very negative pressure (p(X) < - 0.6 rho(X)). Consistent with this picture of dark energy and dark matter are measurements of CMB anisotropy that indicate that, matter and energy together account for the critical density (within 10\%). Fundamental physics beyond the standard model is implicated in both the dark matter and dark energy puzzles: new fundamental particles (e.g., axion or neutralino) and new forms of relativistic energy (e.g., vacuum energy or a light scalar field). Dark matter and dark energy are central issues in both cosmology and particle physics. Over the next two decades a flood of precision cosmological observations and laboratory experiments will shed light on the dark side of the universe. As they do they will advance our understanding of both the universe and the laws of physics that govern it. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SNAP: Supernova/acceleration probe - An experiment to measure the properties of the accelerating universe		A NS-meter satellite telescope with a 1-square-degree optical imager, a small near-In imager, and a three-arm near-UV-to-near-IR spectrograph can discover over 2000 Type Ta supernovae in a year at redshifts between z =0.1 and 1.7, and follow them with high-signal-to-noise calibrated light-curves and spectra. The resulting data set can determine the cosmological parameters with precision: mass density Omega (M) to +/-0.02, vacuum energy density Omega (A) to +/-0.05, and curvature Omega (k) to +/-0.06. The data set can test the nature of the ``dark energy{''} that is apparently accelerating the expansion of the universe. In particular, a cosmological constant dark energy can be differentiated from alternatives including a range of ``quintessence{''} dynamical scalar-field models, by measuring the ratio of the dark energy's pressure to its density to +/-0.05 over a range of redshifts. The large numbers of supernovae across a wide range of redshifts are necessary but not sufficient to accomplish these goals; the controls for systematic uncertainties are primary drivers of the design of this space-based experiment. These systematic and statistical controls cannot be obtained with other ground-based and/or space-based telescopes, either currently in construction or in planning stages.

Dark matter and dark energy in the universe	10.1238/Physica.Topical.085a00210	For the first time, we have a plausible and complete accounting of matter and energy in the Universe. Expressed a fraction of the critical density it goes like this: neutrinos, between 0.3\% and 15\%; stars, between 0.3\% and 0.6\%; baryons (total) 5\% +/- 0.5\%; matter (total), 40\% +/- 10\%; smooth, dark energy, 80\% +/- 20\%; totaling to the critical density (within the errors). This accounting is consistent with the inflationary prediction of a flat Universe and measurements of the anisotropy of the CBR. It also defines three ``dark problems{''}: Where are the dark baryons? What is the nonbaryonic dark matter? What is the nature of the dark energy? The leading candidate for the (optically) dark baryons is diffuse hot gas; the leading candidates for the nonbaryonic dark matter are slowly moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments (cold dark matter), such as axions or neutralinos; the leading candidates for the dark energy involve fundamental physics and include a cosmological constant (vacuum energy), a rolling scalar field (quintessence), and a network of light, frustrated topological defects.

The leading candidate for the (optically) dark baryons is diffuse hot gas; the leading candidates for the nonbaryonic dark matter are slowly moving elementary particles left over from the earliest moments (cold dark matter), such as axions or neutralinos; the leading candidates for the dark energy involve fundamental physics and include a cosmological constant (vacuum energy), a rolling scalar field (quintessence), and light, frustrated topological defects.
