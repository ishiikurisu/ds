# Macros

Studying spreadsheet macros

## Open Office

From
 [OpenOffice](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Calc_Guide/Write_your_own_functions)
explanation on Macros as functions.

Information on OpenOffice BASIC can be found [here](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/BASIC_Guide/Language).

## Excel

[First document read about it.](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Excel_VBA#Making_an_XLA)

Basically, there is a "Macros" menu that works just like Open Office's. Open source devs might just have copied Microsoft's design anyways.
